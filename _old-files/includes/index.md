### Agent System

The agent system (`agents/` directory) provides specialized AI capabilities through a modular architecture:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `class-mpai-agent-orchestrator.php` | Coordinates and routes requests between specialized agents |
| `class-mpai-base-agent.php` | Base functionality for all agents |
| `interface-mpai-agent.php` | Interface that all agents must implement |
| `specialized/` | Implementation of domain-specific agents |
| `sdk/` | Integration with external AI systems and frameworks |

### CLI System

The CLI system (`cli/` directory) provides WordPress command-line integration:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `class-mpai-cli-commands.php` | WP-CLI commands implementation |

### Command System

The command system (`commands/` directory) handles WordPress command processing:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `class-mpai-command-adapter.php` | Adapts commands for execution |
| `class-mpai-command-detector.php` | Detects commands in user input |
| `class-mpai-command-handler.php` | Handles command execution |
| `class-mpai-command-sanitizer.php` | Sanitizes command input |
| `class-mpai-command-security.php` | Security checks for commands |
| `class-mpai-php-executor.php` | PHP code execution |
| `class-mpai-wp-cli-executor.php` | WP-CLI command execution |

### Tool System

The tool system (`tools/` directory) provides functionality for AI to interact with WordPress:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `class-mpai-base-tool.php` | Base functionality for all tools |
| `class-mpai-tool-registry.php` | Registers and manages available tools |
| `implementations/` | Specific tool implementations |

## Integration Points

For developers extending the plugin, here are the key integration points:

1. **New Tools**: Add new tools in `tools/implementations/` by extending `MPAI_Base_Tool`
2. **New Agents**: Create specialized agents in `agents/specialized/` by extending `MPAI_Base_Agent`
3. **Custom Commands**: Extend the command system in the `commands/` directory
4. **UI Customizations**: Modify templates in the `templates/` directory
