# MemberPress AI Assistant - Project Status

## Latest Enhancement: Content Marker System
A robust content marker system has been successfully implemented to solve blog post publishing issues:
- Automatic tagging of blog posts with HTML comment markers and timestamps
- Smart content type detection for blog posts, pages, and memberships
- Three-tiered content retrieval strategy with multiple fallbacks
- Comprehensive documentation in CONTENT_MARKER_SYSTEM.md
- Reliable blog post publishing with correct title and content

## Recent Enhancements

### Console Logging System
The project now includes a comprehensive browser console logging system that provides:
- Different verbosity levels (error, warning, info, debug)
- Category filtering (API calls, tool usage, agent activity, timing)
- Performance timing capabilities
- Configurable settings in the Diagnostics tab
- localStorage persistence for client-side settings
- Test functionality to verify logging is working

### Enhanced Tool Call Detection
The tool call detection system has been significantly improved:
- Fixed the "0 tool calls" issue with improved regex patterns
- Implemented unified pattern processing for different tool call formats
- Added comprehensive diagnostics for troubleshooting
- Added pattern usage statistics to identify which patterns are matching
- Implemented duplicate detection to prevent redundant tool executions

### MemberPress Data Retrieval
Direct member data access has been implemented:
- Added get_new_members_this_month() method to MemberPress API class
- Created fallback to direct database queries when API isn't available
- Implemented nice formatting for member data output
- Enhanced MemberPress Info Tool to support new_members_this_month type
- Updated system prompts with new tool capabilities
