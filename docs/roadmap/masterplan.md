# MemberPress AI Assistant - Master Roadmap Plan

**Version:** 3.0.1  
**Last Updated:** 2025-04-11  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Active

## Overview

This document serves as the comprehensive roadmap for the MemberPress AI Assistant plugin. It consolidates all development plans, priorities, and implementation timelines from previously separate roadmap documents into a single source of truth.

## Current Development Focus

### CRITICAL: Admin UI Overhaul (April-May 2025)

A comprehensive rewrite of the entire admin interface is required due to persistent issues with menu highlighting, tab navigation, and overall UI stability. This overhaul must be completed before moving forward with any other roadmap items. For complete implementation details, see the [Admin UI Overhaul Plan](./admin-ui-overhaul-plan.md).

| Week | Focus Area | Priority Tasks |
|------|------------|----------------|
| 1-2 | Admin Menu System Rewrite | Replace current menu registration system, implement robust parent/child menu relationships, create consistent menu API |
| 3 | Settings Page Architecture | Create modular settings framework, implement proper tab navigation with state persistence, develop reliable global settings API |
| 4 | Diagnostics System Redesign | Rebuild diagnostics UI as standalone page, implement proper AJAX handling for tests, create dedicated diagnostics API |
| 5 | Chat Interface Settings Integration | Redesign chat settings page, improve integration with main settings, add visual configuration options |
| 6 | UI Testing & Quality Assurance | Create comprehensive UI test suite, implement automated navigation tests, develop visual regression testing |

### NEW: Hooks and Filters Implementation (April-May 2025)

A comprehensive implementation of WordPress-style hooks and filters throughout the plugin to enhance extensibility and customization options for developers. This project will be developed in parallel with the Admin UI Overhaul as it addresses a different codebase area. For detailed implementation plan, see the [Hooks and Filters Implementation Plan](./current-development/hooks-filters-implementation-plan.md).

| Week | Focus Area | Priority Tasks |
|------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | Core System Hooks | Implement main plugin initialization hooks, chat processing hooks, system message construction filters |
| 2 | Tool and Agent System Hooks | Add tool execution hooks, agent orchestration hooks, agent selection and scoring filters |
| 3 | Content and UI Hooks | Implement content generation hooks, admin interface hooks, settings and options filters |
| 4 | API and Error Handling Hooks | Add API request/response hooks, error handling hooks, logging system filters |

### NEW: Chat Settings Integration (May 2025)

A focused plan to improve the chat interface settings system, providing better visual configuration options and integrating with the hooks and filters system. This implementation aligns with Week 5 of the Admin UI Overhaul and will serve as a practical application of the hooks system. For detailed implementation plan, see the [Chat Settings Integration Plan](./current-development/chat-settings-integration-plan.md).

| Week | Focus Area | Priority Tasks |
|------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | Settings Consolidation | Identify all existing chat settings, design unified structure, create migration path |
| 2 | UI Development | Design enhanced settings UI, implement visual configuration options, create preview functionality |
| 3 | Hooks Integration | Integrate with hooks system, create developer API, implement settings validation |
| 4 | Advanced Features | Implement role-based settings, page-specific behavior, comprehensive testing |

### Phase 3.5: Completing Essential Features (May-June 2025)

After the Admin UI Overhaul is complete, the following essential features from earlier phases need to be implemented or completed:

| Week | Focus Area | Priority Tasks |
|------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | Error Catalog System | Create MPAI_Error_Catalog class, implement error code system, integrate with Error Recovery |
| 2 | Command System Rewrite | Implement simpler command validation, consolidate execution flow |
| 3 | Connection & Stream Optimizations | Implement Connection Pooling and Stream Processing for API responses |
