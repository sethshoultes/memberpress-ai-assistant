# MemberPress AI Assistant: Hooks and Filters Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to enhance the extensibility of the MemberPress AI Assistant plugin by implementing a consistent hook and filter system throughout the codebase. This will allow developers to customize the plugin's behavior without modifying core files and future-proof the plugin for third-party integrations.

## Goals

- Create a standardized hook and filter system following WordPress best practices
- Implement hooks at key interaction points throughout the plugin architecture
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Provide documentation and examples for developers
- Enable more flexible extension of AI functionality
- Facilitate third-party integrations with other plugins and themes
- Reduce technical debt by decoupling components
- Improve testability of individual components

## Documentation Strategy

1. **Developer Reference:**
   - Create comprehensive hook reference in `/docs/current/developer/hook-filter-reference.md`
   - Document each hook's purpose, parameters, and example usage
   - Include inline PHPDoc comments for all hooks for IDE autocompletion
   - Create hook categorization and index by functional area

2. **Extension Examples:**
   - Create example plugin demonstrating hook usage for each system component
   - Provide code snippets in `/docs/current/developer/code-snippets-repository.md`
   - Create tutorials for common extension scenarios:
     - Adding a custom AI provider
     - Creating a custom tool
     - Modifying content formatting
     - Extending admin UI

3. **Integration Guide:**
   - Update `/docs/current/developer/integration-guidelines.md` with hook usage best practices
   - Create hook decision tree to help developers select appropriate hooks
   - Document compatibility considerations with other plugins
   - Include performance impact guidance for hook implementations

4. **Code Standards:**
   - Document naming conventions for custom hooks in extensions
   - Create code standards for parameter passing in hooks
   - Document recommended testing approaches for hook callbacks

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Create test functions to verify hook execution for every hook
   - Verify proper parameter passing and return value handling
   - Test priority ordering of multiple hook callbacks
   - Test default values for filter hooks
   - Create mocks for common hook integration patterns

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - Test real-world use cases with sample extensions
   - Ensure hooks integrate properly with existing functionality
   - Test hook interactions across different components
   - Test hook performance under load
   - Test hooks with multiple simultaneous callbacks

3. **Regression Testing:**
   - Verify that existing functionality continues to work with hooks in place
   - Test backward compatibility with previous versions
   - Ensure hook additions don't break existing API contracts
   - Validate no memory leaks from hook registrations
   - Run full test suite with no hooks registered to verify fallback behavior

4. **Code Quality Testing:**
   - Static analysis of hook implementation
   - Code coverage analysis for hook execution paths
   - Documentation completeness checks
   - PHPDoc accuracy verification
   - Coding standards compliance

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics
- All planned hooks are implemented and documented (100% coverage of identified points)
- Each hook has at least 2 test cases (positive case and error/edge case)
- Performance impact of hooks remains under 5% overhead when no callbacks registered
- Code cyclomatic complexity does not increase by more than 10%
- All hooks follow WordPress coding standards with zero linting errors
- Hook usage example code passes all standard WordPress compatibility tests

### Functional Success
- Core functionality works without any hooks registered (backward compatibility)
- 3 example extensions demonstrate practical use cases
- Documentation is clear and accessible to developers
- Integration with popular development IDEs (code completion for hooks)
- System follows WordPress hook naming and usage conventions
- Minimum of 3 real-world extension scenarios implemented as proof-of-concept

### Long-term Success Indicators
- Adoption of hooks in third-party extensions within 3 months of release
- Decrease in support tickets related to custom modifications
- Increased developer satisfaction (measured through feedback mechanisms)
- Reduction in core code modifications for custom implementations

## Future Considerations

- Create additional specialized hooks based on developer feedback
- Develop an official extension framework for common customizations
- Consider creating a hook visualization tool for developers

## Potential Challenges and Mitigations

| Challenge | Risk Level | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| **Performance Impact** | Medium | Implement conditional hook execution to skip hooks when no callbacks are registered; add performance monitoring for hook execution times |
| **Backward Compatibility** | High | Create thorough test suite before and after implementation; ensure core functionality works without hooks registered |
| **Overlap with Admin UI Overhaul** | Medium | Coordinate development efforts with Admin UI team; isolate hook implementations from UI-specific code paths |
| **Inconsistent Parameter Passing** | Medium | Define standardized parameter structures for similar hooks; create clear documentation templates for each hook type |
| **Insufficient Test Coverage** | High | Develop comprehensive test harnesses for each hook point; create automated regression tests that verify hook functionality |
| **Documentation Gaps** | Medium | Create hook documentation while implementing, not after; use DocBlock comments in code for better IDE integration |
| **Extension Conflicts** | Low | Develop extension compatibility guidelines; provide conflict detection mechanisms for common extension patterns |

## Resources Required

- Developer time: 4 weeks of dedicated development (with 1 additional week buffer for unexpected issues)
- Testing resources: Multiple WordPress environments for compatibility testing, including multisite installations
- Documentation writer: Technical documentation for hook reference and integration guides
- Code reviewer: Ensure hook implementation follows best practices and performance standards
- QA tester: Dedicated testing of hooks across multiple environments and configurations

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Naming Conventions:**
   - Action hooks: verb_noun format (e.g., `mpai_process_message`)
   - Filter hooks: noun_descriptor format (e.g., `mpai_api_credentials`)
   - Consistent `mpai_` prefix for all hooks

2. **Parameter Passing:**
   - Pass objects by reference only when necessary
   - Include context parameters for all hooks
   - Ensure all parameters are documented and typed where possible

3. **Version Control:**
   - Implement hooks in isolated feature branches
   - Create detailed commit messages explaining hook purpose
   - Tag all hook-related commits for easy reference

4. **Deprecation Strategy:**
   - Document process for eventual hook deprecation
   - Create utility functions for backwards compatibility
   - Plan for minimum 2 version cycles before removing deprecated hooks
