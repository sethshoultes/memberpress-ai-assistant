## Master Roadmap Plan

The [Master Roadmap Plan](./masterplan.md) is now the comprehensive source of truth for all development plans, priorities, and implementation timelines. This consolidated document provides a clear overview of:

- Current development focus and priorities
- Implementation phases and timelines
- Feature status dashboard
- Success criteria and implementation principles
- Documentation requirements and contribution guidelines

## Current Development Focus

### CRITICAL: Admin UI Overhaul (April-May 2025)

A complete rewrite of the admin interface is the current critical priority due to persistent issues with menu highlighting, tab navigation, and overall UI stability.

See the [Master Roadmap Plan](./masterplan.md#current-development-focus) for detailed implementation timeline.

### Phase 3.5: Essential Features (May-June 2025)

After the Admin UI Overhaul, we'll implement several essential features from earlier phases:
- Error Catalog System
- Command System Rewrite
- Connection & Stream Optimizations

## Feature Status Dashboard

For a complete overview of all features and their current status, see the [Feature Status Dashboard](./masterplan.md#feature-status-dashboard) section in the Master Roadmap Plan.
