# Feature Roadmap Documentation

This directory contains documentation for features that are planned or in development for future versions of MemberPress AI Assistant. These documents outline the design and implementation plans for upcoming features.

## Phase 3.5: Completing Essential Features (April 2025)

Before moving fully into the security-focused Phase Four, the following essential features from earlier phases need to be implemented or completed:

### Implementation Order and Priority Tasks

| Week | Focus Area | Starting Files | Priority Tasks |
|------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Error Catalog System | [error-catalog-system.md](../current/error-system/error-catalog-system.md) | Create MPAI_Error_Catalog class, implement error code system, integrate with Error Recovery |
| 2 | Command System Rewrite | [command-system-rewrite-plan.md](../current/feature-plans/command-system-rewrite-plan.md) | Implement simpler command validation, consolidate execution flow |
| 3 | Connection & Stream Optimizations | [_2_performance-optimization-plan.md](./_2_performance-optimization-plan.md) | Implement Connection Pooling and Stream Processing for API responses |

## Phase Four Development Roadmap (May-June 2025)

Once Phase 3.5 is complete, Phase Four will focus on security enhancements and compliance features. The following components should be implemented in priority order:

1. **Agentic Security Framework** - Begin with the agent validation system
2. **WordPress Security Integration** - Focus on capability mapping and nonce systems  
3. **Integrated Security Implementation** - Combine all security systems into unified approach
