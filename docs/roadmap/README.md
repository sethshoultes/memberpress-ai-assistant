- Current development focus and priorities
- Implementation phases and timelines
- Feature status dashboard
- Success criteria and implementation principles
- Documentation requirements and contribution guidelines

## Current Development Focus

### CRITICAL: Admin UI Overhaul (April-May 2025)

A complete rewrite of the admin interface is the current critical priority due to persistent issues with menu highlighting, tab navigation, and overall UI stability.

See the [Master Roadmap Plan](./masterplan.md#current-development-focus) for detailed implementation timeline.

### NEW: Hooks and Filters Implementation (April-May 2025)

A comprehensive plan to implement WordPress-style hooks and filters throughout the plugin to enhance extensibility and customization. This will be developed in parallel with the Admin UI Overhaul.

See the [Hooks and Filters Implementation Plan](./current-development/hooks-filters-implementation-plan.md) for detailed information.

### NEW: Chat Settings Integration (May 2025)

A focused plan to improve the chat interface settings system, providing better visual configuration options and integrating with the hooks and filters system. This will align with Week 5 of the Admin UI Overhaul.

See the [Chat Settings Integration Plan](./current-development/chat-settings-integration-plan.md) for detailed information.

### Phase 3.5: Essential Features (May-June 2025)

After the Admin UI Overhaul, we'll implement several essential features from earlier phases:
- Error Catalog System
