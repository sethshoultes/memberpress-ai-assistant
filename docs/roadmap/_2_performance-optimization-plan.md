# Performance Optimization Plan

## Overview

This document outlines strategies to improve the performance of the MemberPress AI Assistant plugin, focusing on reducing latency, optimizing memory usage, and improving the user experience.

## Current Performance Challenges

1. **API Latency**: Calls to AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic) introduce significant delays
2. **Memory Overhead**: Loading all tools and agents on initialization creates memory pressure
3. **Redundant Operations**: Repeated system information queries consume resources unnecessarily
4. **JavaScript Execution**: Current tool detection patterns can be inefficient
5. **Database Interactions**: Suboptimal memory and logging operations impact responsiveness
