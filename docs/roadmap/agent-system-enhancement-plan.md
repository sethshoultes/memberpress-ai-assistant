# Agent System Enhancement & Performance Optimization Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to enhance the MemberPress AI Assistant's agent system capabilities while also improving performance and ensuring stability through better testing.

## 1. Agent System Enhancements

### 1.1 Agent Discovery Mechanism
- **Current Limitation**: Agents are statically registered in `register_core_agents()` with only two agent types
- **Implementation Plan**: 
  - Create a dynamic discovery system that scans the `agents/specialized` directory
  - Add auto-registration capabilities for new agents that follow naming conventions
  - Add filtering capability with `apply_filters('mpai_available_agents', $agents)`
- **Files to Modify**: `includes/agents/class-mpai-agent-orchestrator.php`
- **Expected Benefit**: Easier extension with specialized agents without core code modification

### 1.2 Agent Specialization Scoring
- **Current Limitation**: Intent determination uses basic keyword matching
- **Implementation Plan**:
  - Implement a confidence scoring system (0-100)
  - Allow each agent to evaluate its capability to handle a specific request
  - Create a weighted scoring algorithm that considers keywords, context, and previous interactions
- **Files to Modify**:
  - `includes/agents/class-mpai-agent-orchestrator.php`
  - `includes/agents/class-mpai-base-agent.php` (add scoring method)
  - `includes/agents/specialized/*` (implement scoring logic)
- **Expected Benefit**: More accurate request routing to the most appropriate specialized agent

### 1.3 Inter-Agent Communication Protocol
- **Current Limitation**: Limited handoff capabilities between agents
- **Implementation Plan**:
  - Design a structured messaging format for agent communication
  - Add capability to maintain context across agent handoffs
  - Implement conversation state preservation between different agents
- **Files to Modify**:
  - `includes/agents/class-mpai-agent-orchestrator.php`
  - `includes/agents/interfaces/interface-mpai-agent.php` (add communication methods)
- **Expected Benefit**: More sophisticated multi-agent problem solving

### 1.4 Agent Memory Management System
- **Current Limitation**: Basic memory storage with simple item limit
- **Implementation Plan**:
  - Develop importance-based memory retention
  - Add conversation thread and context window management
  - Implement vector-based retrieval capabilities for relevance
- **Files to Create/Modify**:
  - `includes/class-mpai-memory-manager.php` (new)
  - `includes/agents/class-mpai-agent-orchestrator.php`
- **Expected Benefit**: Better conversation continuity and reduced repetition

## 2. Performance Optimization

### 2.1 Tool Lazy-Loading
- **Current Limitation**: All tools loaded during initialization even when not needed
- **Implementation Plan**:
  - Convert to load tools on-demand when first requested
  - Create a static registry for faster subsequent access
  - Add initialization flags to prevent redundant loading
- **Files to Modify**:
  - `includes/agents/class-mpai-agent-orchestrator.php`
  - `includes/tools/class-mpai-tool-registry.php`
- **Expected Benefit**: Faster startup times and lower memory consumption

### 2.2 Response Caching Layer
- **Current Limitation**: Every API request processed as new, even for similar queries
- **Implementation Plan**:
  - Implement LRU cache for AI API responses
  - Add configurable TTL and cache invalidation strategies
  - Create admin controls for cache management
- **Files to Create/Modify**:
  - `includes/class-mpai-response-cache.php` (new)
  - `includes/class-mpai-anthropic.php`
  - `includes/class-mpai-openai.php`
- **Expected Benefit**: Faster responses and reduced API costs

### 2.3 PHP Info & Plugin Status Caching
- **Current Limitation**: Repeated expensive operations for common system queries
- **Implementation Plan**:
  - Create a dedicated system information cache
  - Add timed refresh mechanism (hourly/daily)
  - Preload common query results during initialization
- **Files to Create/Modify**:
  - `includes/class-mpai-system-cache.php` (new)
  - `includes/tools/implementations/class-mpai-wpcli-tool.php`
- **Expected Benefit**: Significantly improved performance for common system queries

### 2.4 SDK Integration Optimization
- **Current Limitation**: SDK integration has high initialization overhead
- **Implementation Plan**:
  - Implement lazy initialization for SDK components
  - Add caching for SDK configuration
  - Optimize tool registration process
- **Files to Modify**:
  - `includes/agents/sdk/class-mpai-sdk-integration.php`
- **Expected Benefit**: Faster startup and reduced memory footprint

## 3. Testing & Stability

### 3.1 Unit Tests for Agent System
- **Current Limitation**: Missing automated testing for agent orchestration
- **Implementation Plan**:
  - Create PHPUnit tests for agent registration and routing
  - Test agent handoff mechanisms
  - Verify intent determination logic
- **Files to Create**:
  - `test/unit/agents/test-agent-orchestrator.php`
  - `test/unit/agents/test-agent-handoff.php`
- **Expected Benefit**: Reduced regression bugs during system modifications

### 3.2 Integration Tests for Tool Execution
- **Current Limitation**: Complex tool recovery logic lacks systematic testing
- **Implementation Plan**:
  - Create tests that simulate tool failures and verify recovery
  - Test tool discovery and registration edge cases
  - Validate tool execution under various conditions
- **Files to Create**:
  - `test/integration/tools/test-tool-recovery.php`
  - `test/integration/tools/test-tool-execution.php`
- **Expected Benefit**: Better stability for critical tool execution

### 3.3 AI Response Validation System
- **Current Limitation**: AI responses lack quality verification
- **Implementation Plan**:
  - Add verification system for AI responses
  - Check for hallucinations and response quality
  - Implement automatic retry for problematic responses
- **Files to Create/Modify**:
  - `includes/class-mpai-response-validator.php` (new)
  - `includes/class-mpai-anthropic.php`
- **Expected Benefit**: More reliable AI-generated content

### 3.4 Error Recovery System
- **Current Limitation**: Error handling is inconsistent across components
- **Implementation Plan**:
  - Create standardized error recovery frameworks
  - Implement graceful degradation for non-critical failures
  - Add detailed error logging with context
- **Files to Create/Modify**:
  - `includes/class-mpai-error-recovery.php` (new)
  - Various component files
- **Expected Benefit**: More resilient system that handles failures gracefully
