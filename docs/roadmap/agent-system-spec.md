# MemberPress AI Assistant Agent System Specification

## Overview

The MemberPress AI Assistant Agent System is an advanced framework that enables specialized AI agents to perform specific tasks through natural language commands. These agents can execute CLI commands, generate content, perform security audits, and handle other WordPress and MemberPress-specific tasks.

## System Architecture

### 1. Agent Orchestrator

The Agent Orchestrator is the central component that:
- Processes natural language requests from users
- Determines which specialized agent(s) should handle the request
- Coordinates multi-agent workflows
- Returns consolidated results to the user

### 2. Specialized Agents

Each specialized agent focuses on a specific domain or task set:

| Agent | Primary Purpose | Key Capabilities |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| Content Agent | Create and edit content | Write blog posts, create pages, optimize existing content |
| System Agent | Manage WordPress system | Run WP-CLI commands, update plugins, manage backups |
| Security Agent | Monitor and enhance security | Perform security audits, fix vulnerabilities, manage permissions |
| Analytics Agent | Analyze site performance | Generate reports, recommend optimizations, track user behavior |
| MemberPress Agent | Manage MemberPress specifics | Handle memberships, transactions, subscriptions |

### 3. Tool Integration Layer

The Tool Integration Layer provides agents with access to various tools:
- WP-CLI command execution
- Content creation and editing tools
- Database interaction capabilities
- File system access (limited to WordPress content)
- External API connections (SEO tools, security scanners, etc.)

### 4. Memory and Context System

Each agent maintains:
- Short-term memory (current session)
- Long-term memory (stored in database)
- Access to shared knowledge base
- User preference profiles

## User Experience

Users interact with the system through:
1. Natural language chat interface (existing chat bubble)
2. Command suggestions based on user intent
3. Step-by-step guidance for complex tasks
4. Visual feedback for actions performed

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-4 weeks)

## Technical Specifications

### Agent Orchestrator

```php
class MPAI_Agent_Orchestrator {
    // Core properties
    private $agents = [];
    private $context_manager;
    private $command_registry;
    
    // Methods
    public function register_agent($agent_id, $agent_instance);
    public function process_request($user_message);
    public function determine_intent($message);
    public function dispatch_to_agent($agent_id, $intent_data);
    public function coordinate_multi_agent_workflow($workflow_definition);
}
```

### Base Agent Class

```php
abstract class MPAI_Base_Agent {
    // Core properties
    protected $id;
    protected $name;
    protected $description;
    protected $capabilities = [];
    protected $context;
    protected $memory;
    
    // Methods
    abstract public function process_request($intent_data);
    abstract public function get_capabilities();
    protected function execute_tool($tool_id, $parameters);
    protected function update_memory($key, $value);
    protected function get_from_memory($key);
}
```

### Specialized Agent Example (Content Agent)

```php
class MPAI_Content_Agent extends MPAI_Base_Agent {
    // Content-specific properties
    private $content_templates;
    private $writing_styles;
    
    // Content-specific methods
    public function generate_blog_post($title, $keywords, $length);
    public function optimize_content($content_id, $target_keywords);
    public function create_page($title, $sections, $meta_description);
    public function suggest_content_improvements($content_id);
}
```

### Tool Integration Example (WP-CLI)

```php
class MPAI_WP_CLI_Tool {
    // Properties
    private $allowed_commands = [];
    private $execution_timeout = 30; // seconds
    
    // Methods
    public function execute_command($command);
    public function validate_command($command);
    public function parse_command_output($output, $format = 'plain');
    public function get_command_suggestions($task_description);
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Command Validation**
   - All WP-CLI commands must be validated against an allowlist
   - Pattern matching to prevent command injection
   - Execution timeout limits

2. **Permission Controls**
   - User capability checks before agent actions
   - Granular permission system for each agent type
   - Audit logging of all agent actions

3. **Content Protection**
   - Sanitization of all generated content
   - Review process for critical changes
   - Version history and rollback capabilities

4. **System Integrity**
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Resource usage monitoring
   - Fallback modes for high-load situations

## Data Flow

1. User submits natural language request
2. Orchestrator analyzes intent and determines appropriate agent(s)
3. Agent(s) plan necessary actions using available tools
4. Tools execute actions with proper validation
5. Results are collected and consolidated
6. Formatted response is returned to user
7. Action and result are logged for future reference

## API Endpoints
