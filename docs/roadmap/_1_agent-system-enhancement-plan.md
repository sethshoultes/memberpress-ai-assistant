# Agent System Enhancement & Performance Optimization Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to enhance the MemberPress AI Assistant's agent system capabilities while also improving performance and ensuring stability through better testing.

## 1. Agent System Enhancements

### 1.1 Agent Discovery Mechanism ✅
- **Current Limitation**: Agents are statically registered in `register_core_agents()` with only two agent types
- **Implementation Plan**:

  - `includes/agents/class-mpai-agent-orchestrator.php` ✅
  - Phase One test implementation in `direct-ajax-handler.php` ✅
- **Status**: Agent discovery mechanism implemented and verified:
  - Orchestrator successfully discovers and registers available agents
  - Agent properties and methods are properly validated
  - Agent structure is verified during registration
  - Phase One test in System Diagnostics verifies functionality
- **Expected Benefit**: Easier extension with specialized agents without core code modification

### 1.2 Agent Specialization Scoring
- **Current Limitation**: Intent determination uses basic keyword matching

  - Allow each agent to evaluate its capability to handle a specific request
  - Create a weighted scoring algorithm that considers keywords, context, and previous interactions
- **Files to Modify**:
  - `includes/agents/class-mpai-agent-orchestrator.php`

- **Status**: Lazy loading framework implemented and verified:
  - Tool registry can register tool definitions without loading files
  - Tools are loaded on demand when requested the first time
  - Available tools list includes both loaded and unloaded tools
  - Phase One test in System Diagnostics verifies functionality
- **Expected Benefit**: Faster startup times and lower memory consumption

### 2.2 Response Caching Layer ✅
- **Current Limitation**: Every API request processed as new, even for similar queries
- **Implementation Plan**:
  - Implement in-memory cache for AI API responses ✅
  - Add TTL-based expiration for cache items ✅
  - Create serialization for complex data structures ✅
- **Files Created/Modified**:
  - `includes/class-mpai-response-cache.php` (new) ✅

  - TTL-based expiration implementation
  - Phase One test in System Diagnostics verifies functionality
- **Expected Benefit**: Faster responses and reduced API costs

### 2.3 PHP Info & Plugin Status Caching
- **Current Limitation**: Repeated expensive operations for common system queries
- **Implementation Plan**:
  - Create a dedicated system information cache
  - Add timed refresh mechanism (hourly/daily)
  - Preload common query results during initialization
- **Files to Create/Modify**:
  - `includes/class-mpai-system-cache.php` (new)
  - `includes/tools/implementations/class-mpai-wpcli-tool.php`
- **Expected Benefit**: Significantly improved performance for common system queries

### 2.4 SDK Integration Optimization
- **Current Limitation**: SDK integration has high initialization overhead
- **Implementation Plan**:
  - Implement lazy initialization for SDK components
  - Add caching for SDK configuration
  - Optimize tool registration process
