# Archived Roadmap Documents

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-04-06  
**Status:** üóÑÔ∏è Archived

This directory contains archived roadmap documents that have been superseded by the consolidated [Master Roadmap Plan](../masterplan.md).

## About These Archives

These documents represent previous planning phases for the MemberPress AI Assistant and are preserved for historical reference. While they contain valuable implementation details, the authoritative source for current development priorities is now the Master Roadmap Plan.

## Archived Documents

| Document | Original Purpose | Reason for Archiving |
|----------|------------------|----------------------|
| [_0_implementation-guide.md](./_0_implementation-guide.md) | Step-by-step implementation instructions | Consolidated into the Master Roadmap Plan |
| [_1_agent-system-enhancement-plan.md](./_1_agent-system-enhancement-plan.md) | Agent system improvements | Consolidated into the Master Roadmap Plan |
| [_2_performance-optimization-plan.md](./_2_performance-optimization-plan.md) | Performance optimizations | Consolidated into the Master Roadmap Plan |
| [_3_testing-stability-plan.md](./_3_testing-stability-plan.md) | Testing framework and stability | Consolidated into the Master Roadmap Plan |

## Historical Context

These documents were created during the initial development phases of the MemberPress AI Assistant. They represent the original planning approach which involved separate documents for different aspects of the system.

As the project matured, these separate documents were consolidated into a single Master Roadmap Plan for easier maintenance and better alignment of priorities.

## Using These Archives

While these documents are no longer actively maintained, they contain detailed implementation guidance that may be useful for understanding:

1. Agent system architecture and enhancements
2. Performance optimization techniques
3. Testing methodologies and stability improvements
4. Implementation approaches for various features

For current development priorities and plans, please refer to the [Master Roadmap Plan](../masterplan.md) instead.
