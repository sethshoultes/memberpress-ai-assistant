## Architecture Overview

The MemberPress AI Assistant plugin is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns and allows for easy extension and customization. The main components of the architecture are:

### Core Components

- **Chat Interface**: Provides the user interface for interacting with the AI assistant
- **Agent System**: Routes requests to specialized agents based on the user's intent
- **Tool System**: Enables the AI assistant to perform actions on the WordPress site
- **Context Manager**: Manages the context of the conversation and provides relevant information to the AI assistant
- **Error Recovery**: Handles errors and provides fallback mechanisms
- **Logging**: Records events and errors for debugging and analysis

### Agent System

The Agent System is responsible for routing requests to specialized agents based on the user's intent. It consists of:

- **Agent Orchestrator**: Routes requests to the appropriate agent
- **Base Agent**: Provides a common interface for all agents
- **Specialized Agents**: Provide specialized capabilities for specific tasks

### Tool System

The Tool System enables the AI assistant to perform actions on the WordPress site. It consists of:

- **Tool Registry**: Manages the registration and retrieval of tools
- **Base Tool**: Provides a common interface for all tools
- **Tool Implementations**: Specific tools that perform actions
- **Tool Call Detection**: Detects and processes tool calls in AI responses

### Integration with MemberPress

The plugin integrates with MemberPress through:

- **MemberPress API**: Provides access to MemberPress data and functionality
- **MemberPress Agent**: Provides specialized capabilities for MemberPress-related tasks
- **MemberPress Hooks**: Allows the plugin to respond to MemberPress events

## Design Patterns

The plugin uses several design patterns to ensure maintainability, extensibility, and robustness:

- **Singleton**: Used for classes that should have only one instance, such as the Agent Orchestrator and Tool Registry
- **Factory**: Used for creating instances of agents and tools
- **Strategy**: Used for implementing different strategies for handling requests
- **Observer**: Used for responding to events
- **Adapter**: Used for adapting external APIs to the plugin's internal interfaces

## Security Architecture

The plugin includes several security measures:

- **Command Validation**: Prevents execution of dangerous commands
- **Permission Checks**: Ensures only authorized users can execute tools and agents
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse
- **Logging**: Records events and errors for auditing

## Performance Considerations

The plugin is designed to be performant even under heavy load:

- **Caching**: Reduces the need for expensive operations
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Allows long-running tasks to be processed in the background
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Minimizes memory usage
- **Optimized Algorithms**: Reduces CPU usage

## Scalability

The plugin is designed to scale with the size of your WordPress site:

- **Modular Architecture**: Allows components to be scaled independently
- **Stateless Design**: Minimizes the need for shared state
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Minimizes the impact on the WordPress site

## Integration Points

The plugin provides several integration points for other plugins and themes:

- **Hooks and Filters**: Allow other plugins to modify the behavior of the AI assistant
- **JavaScript API**: Allows themes and plugins to interact with the AI assistant
- **PHP API**: Allows server-side code to interact with the AI assistant
