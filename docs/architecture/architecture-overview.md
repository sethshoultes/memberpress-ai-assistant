## Data Flow

The data flow through the system follows a clear path:

1. The user enters a message in the Chat Interface
2. The message is sent to the server via AJAX
3. The server processes the message using the Agent System
4. The Agent Orchestrator determines the user's intent and routes the request to the appropriate agent
5. The agent processes the request, potentially using tools from the Tool System
6. The agent generates a response, which may include tool calls
7. The response is sent back to the client
8. The Chat Interface displays the response to the user
9. If the response includes tool calls, the Tool Call Detection system identifies them and initiates tool execution
10. The results of tool execution are displayed to the user

## Design Patterns

The plugin uses several design patterns to ensure maintainability, extensibility, and robustness:

### Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern is used for classes that should have only one instance throughout the application lifecycle, such as the Agent Orchestrator and Tool Registry.

Example:
```php
class MPAI_Agent_Orchestrator {
    private static $instance = null;
    
    public static function get_instance() {
        if (self::$instance === null) {
            self::$instance = new self();
        }
        
        return self::$instance;
    }
    
    private function __construct() {
        // Initialization code
    }
}
```

### Factory Pattern

The Factory pattern is used for creating instances of agents and tools. It provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

Example:
```php
class MPAI_Agent_Factory {
    public static function create_agent($type) {
        switch ($type) {
            case 'memberpress':
                return new MPAI_MemberPress_Agent();
            case 'command_validation':
                return new MPAI_Command_Validation_Agent();
            default:
                throw new Exception("Unknown agent type: {$type}");
        }
    }
}
```

### Strategy Pattern

The Strategy pattern is used for implementing different strategies for handling requests. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

Example:
```php
interface MPAI_Response_Strategy {
    public function generate_response($message, $context);
}

class MPAI_OpenAI_Strategy implements MPAI_Response_Strategy {
    public function generate_response($message, $context) {
        // Generate response using OpenAI
    }
}

class MPAI_Anthropic_Strategy implements MPAI_Response_Strategy {
    public function generate_response($message, $context) {
        // Generate response using Anthropic
    }
}
```

### Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern is used for responding to events. It defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Example:
```php
class MPAI_Event_Manager {
    private $listeners = [];
    
    public function add_listener($event, $callback) {
        if (!isset($this->listeners[$event])) {
            $this->listeners[$event] = [];
        }
        
        $this->listeners[$event][] = $callback;
    }
    
    public function trigger_event($event, $data = []) {
        if (isset($this->listeners[$event])) {
            foreach ($this->listeners[$event] as $callback) {
                call_user_func($callback, $data);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Adapter Pattern

The Adapter pattern is used for adapting external APIs to the plugin's internal interfaces. It allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.

Example:
```php
interface MPAI_AI_Provider {
    public function generate_response($message, $context);
}

class MPAI_OpenAI_Adapter implements MPAI_AI_Provider {
    private $openai;
    
    public function __construct($openai) {
        $this->openai = $openai;
    }
    
    public function generate_response($message, $context) {
        // Adapt OpenAI API to the plugin's interface
    }
}

class MPAI_Anthropic_Adapter implements MPAI_AI_Provider {
    private $anthropic;
    
    public function __construct($anthropic) {
        $this->anthropic = $anthropic;
    }
    
    public function generate_response($message, $context) {
        // Adapt Anthropic API to the plugin's interface
    }
}
```

## Security Architecture

The plugin includes several security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities:

### Input Validation

All user input is validated before processing to prevent injection attacks and other security issues.

### Permission Checks

The plugin checks user permissions before allowing access to sensitive functionality. It uses WordPress capabilities and custom permission rules to ensure that only authorized users can perform certain actions.

### Rate Limiting

The plugin includes rate limiting to prevent abuse. It restricts the number of requests that can be made within a certain time period.

### Secure Communication

The plugin uses secure communication channels (HTTPS) for all API requests to ensure that sensitive data is not intercepted.

### Data Sanitization

All data is sanitized before display to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

### Error Handling

The plugin includes robust error handling to ensure that errors do not expose sensitive information.

## Performance Considerations
