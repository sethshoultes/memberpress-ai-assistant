# Consent Form Testing Plan

This document outlines the testing plan for the consent form implementation in the MemberPress AI Assistant plugin.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Functionality

#### 1.1 Consent Form Display

**Test Steps:**
1. Log in as an administrator
2. Navigate to the MemberPress AI Assistant dashboard
3. Verify that the consent form is displayed if the user hasn't consented

**Expected Result:**
- The consent form should be displayed with a checkbox and "Get Started" button
- The "Get Started" button should be disabled initially

#### 1.2 Checkbox Interaction

**Test Steps:**
1. Click the checkbox in the consent form
2. Observe the state of the "Get Started" button

**Expected Result:**
- The checkbox should become checked
- The "Get Started" button should become enabled
- The visual styling should update to indicate the button is now clickable

#### 1.3 Form Submission

**Test Steps:**
1. Check the consent checkbox
2. Click the "Get Started" button
3. Observe the redirection

**Expected Result:**
- The form should submit successfully
- The user should be redirected to the dashboard with a success message
- The consent should be saved in the user meta

### 2. Edge Cases

#### 2.1 Form Submission Without Checkbox

**Test Steps:**
1. Leave the checkbox unchecked
2. Try to submit the form (by clicking the disabled button or using browser developer tools to enable it)

**Expected Result:**
- The form should not submit
- An error message should be displayed

#### 2.2 Direct URL Access

**Test Steps:**
1. Log in as a user who hasn't consented
2. Try to access the chat interface directly via URL

**Expected Result:**
- The chat interface should not be accessible
- The user should be redirected to the consent form

#### 2.3 Nonce Verification

**Test Steps:**
1. Modify the form's nonce value using browser developer tools
2. Submit the form

**Expected Result:**
- The form submission should fail
- A security error message should be displayed

### 3. Multi-User Testing

#### 3.1 Different User Roles

**Test Steps:**
1. Test the consent form with different user roles (admin, editor, author, etc.)
2. Verify that consent is tracked separately for each user

**Expected Result:**
- Each user should have their own consent status
- Consent given by one user should not affect other users

#### 3.2 Multiple Browsers/Sessions

**Test Steps:**
1. Log in as the same user in different browsers or sessions
2. Give consent in one session
3. Refresh the other session

**Expected Result:**
- The consent status should be consistent across sessions
- After refreshing, the second session should recognize that consent has been given

### 4. Plugin Deactivation

#### 4.1 Consent Reset on Deactivation

**Test Steps:**
1. Give consent as multiple users
2. Deactivate the plugin
3. Reactivate the plugin
4. Log in as the same users

**Expected Result:**
- After reactivation, all users should be prompted for consent again
- The consent form should be displayed as if no consent had been given before

### 5. JavaScript Functionality

#### 5.1 Terms Modal

**Test Steps:**
1. Click the "Review Full Terms" link
2. Verify that the terms modal appears
3. Click the "Close" button in the modal

**Expected Result:**
- The modal should display with the full terms and conditions
- The modal should close when the "Close" button is clicked

#### 5.2 Label Click Behavior

**Test Steps:**
1. Click on the text label next to the checkbox (not directly on the checkbox)
2. Observe the checkbox state

**Expected Result:**
- The checkbox should toggle its state
- The "Get Started" button should update accordingly

#### 5.3 JavaScript Disabled

**Test Steps:**
1. Disable JavaScript in the browser
2. Load the consent form page

**Expected Result:**
- The form should still be functional (though without dynamic features)
- The checkbox and submit button should work correctly

### 6. Integration Testing

#### 6.1 Chat Interface Integration

**Test Steps:**
1. Give consent as a user
2. Verify that the chat interface is accessible
3. Revoke consent (if applicable)
4. Verify that the chat interface is no longer accessible

**Expected Result:**
- The chat interface should only be accessible to users who have given consent
- Changes to consent status should immediately affect access to the chat interface

#### 6.2 Admin Dashboard Integration

**Test Steps:**
1. Give consent as a user
2. Navigate to the admin dashboard
3. Verify that the dashboard displays correctly without the consent form

**Expected Result:**
- After giving consent, the dashboard should display normally
- The consent form should not be shown again unless consent is reset

## Regression Testing

### 1. Existing Functionality

**Test Steps:**
1. Verify that all existing plugin functionality works correctly after implementing the consent form
2. Test key features like chat, settings, and admin pages

**Expected Result:**
- All existing functionality should continue to work as expected
- The consent form implementation should not break any existing features

### 2. Performance Impact

**Test Steps:**
1. Measure page load times before and after implementing the consent form
2. Check for any JavaScript errors or performance issues

**Expected Result:**
- The consent form should not significantly impact page load times
- There should be no JavaScript errors or console warnings

## Browser Compatibility

Test the consent form in the following browsers:

1. Chrome (latest)
2. Firefox (latest)
3. Safari (latest)
4. Edge (latest)

## Mobile Responsiveness

Test the consent form on various screen sizes:

1. Desktop (1920x1080)
2. Laptop (1366x768)
3. Tablet (768x1024)
4. Mobile (375x667)

## Accessibility Testing

1. Keyboard navigation (tab order, focus states)
2. Screen reader compatibility
3. Color contrast
4. Text size and readability

## Security Testing

1. XSS vulnerability testing
2. CSRF protection
3. Data validation and sanitization

## Documentation Review

1. Verify that all hooks and filters are properly documented
2. Ensure that the developer documentation is accurate and complete
