## Installation & Activation Issues

### Plugin Won't Install

**Symptoms**: Installation fails with error message or silently fails.

**Potential Causes and Solutions**:

1. **Insufficient Server Permissions**:
   - Ensure WordPress has proper file permissions (typically 755 for directories, 644 for files)
   - Contact your hosting provider if permission issues persist

2. **Memory Limit Reached**:
   - Temporarily increase PHP memory limit in wp-config.php:
     ```php
     define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '256M');
     ```
   - After installation, return to previous setting if needed

3. **Incompatible WordPress Version**:
   - Upgrade WordPress to version 6.0 or higher
   - If you cannot upgrade WordPress, consider using an older version of the plugin (contact support)

4. **Plugin File Corrupted**:
   - Re-download the plugin from your MemberPress account

   - Install any missing PHP extensions:
     - cURL
     - JSON
     - OpenSSL

2. **Plugin Conflict**:
   - Temporarily deactivate all other plugins
   - Activate MemberPress AI Assistant
   - Re-activate other plugins one by one to identify the conflict

3. **Database Table Creation Failed**:
   - Check database permissions
   - Verify WordPress database user has CREATE TABLE privileges
   - Run manual table creation (contact support for SQL scripts)

### License Validation Issues

**Symptoms**: License activation fails or plugin shows "Invalid License" message.

**Potential Causes and Solutions**:

1. **Incorrect License Key**:
   - Verify license key is entered correctly (check for typos or extra spaces)
   - Copy and paste the license key directly from your MemberPress account

2. **License Usage Limit Reached**:
   - Check license usage in your MemberPress account
   - Deactivate license on unused sites
   - Upgrade to a license with more sites if needed

3. **Connection to License Server Failed**:
   - Verify your site can reach api.memberpress.com
   - Check if your server blocks outgoing connections
   - Temporarily disable firewall or security plugins

## Configuration Problems
