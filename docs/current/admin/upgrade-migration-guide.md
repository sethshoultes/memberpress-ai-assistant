## Migration Best Practices

Follow these best practices for all migration and upgrade scenarios:

### Planning Best Practices

- **Always Have a Rollback Plan**: Never start a migration without the ability to revert
- **Test in Staging First**: Always perform migrations in staging environments first
- **Document Everything**: Create detailed documentation of every step and decision
- **Schedule During Low Traffic**: Perform migrations during periods of minimal usage
- **Communicate Plans**: Inform users of maintenance windows and expected changes

### Execution Best Practices

- **One Change at a Time**: Make incremental changes rather than massive migrations
- **Verify Each Step**: Test after each significant step before proceeding
- **Monitor Closely**: Watch system metrics during and after migration
- **Keep Backups Accessible**: Store backups where they can be quickly retrieved
- **Have Expert Support Available**: Ensure knowledgeable personnel are available during migration

### Post-Migration Best Practices

- **Gather User Feedback**: Actively solicit feedback after migration
- **Monitor for Issues**: Watch for unexpected behavior for several days
- **Document Lessons Learned**: Record what worked and what didn't for future migrations
- **Update Procedures**: Refine your migration procedures based on experience
- **Clean Up Temporary Files**: Remove backup and temporary files when no longer needed
