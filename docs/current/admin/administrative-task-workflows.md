   - Test trigger activation

4. **Design Workflow Actions**
   - Add sequential actions:
     - Data retrieval
     - External API calls
     - User notifications
     - System modifications
   - Configure action parameters
   - Set conditional logic between actions
   - Define error handling

5. **Implement Response Templates**
   - Create custom response formats
   - Design progress indicators

## Creating Custom Workflows

### Guidelines for Creating Your Own Administrative Workflows

As your MemberPress AI Assistant implementation matures, you may need to create custom administrative workflows specific to your organization. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Identify Workflow Candidates**
   - Look for repetitive administrative tasks
   - Identify error-prone manual processes
   - Consider tasks requiring consistent execution
   - Focus on time-consuming activities

2. **Document Workflow Requirements**
   - Define clear start and end points
   - List all required steps in sequence
   - Identify data inputs and outputs
   - Document decision points and conditions
   - Define success criteria

3. **Create Workflow Structure**
   - Use the workflow template at **MemberPress ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí AI Assistant ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Custom Workflows**
   - Name and describe your workflow
   - Map out sequence of actions
   - Define triggers and conditions
   - Document each step thoroughly

4. **Test and Refine**
   - Run workflow in test environment
   - Verify correct execution
   - Identify bottlenecks or errors
   - Refine workflow steps
   - Document improvements

5. **Document and Share**
   - Create clear workflow documentation
   - Train team members on execution
   - Store workflow in central repository
   - Schedule regular workflow reviews
   - Gather feedback for improvement

**Example: Custom Membership Audit Workflow**

```
Workflow Name: Monthly Membership Audit
Trigger: First day of month, 2:00 AM
Purpose: Verify membership data integrity and generate report

Steps:
1. Run MemberPress data validation check
2. Verify AI knowledge base accuracy for membership data
3. Generate comparison report of discrepancies
4. If discrepancies > 1%, trigger alert to administrators
5. Update AI knowledge base with correct data
6. Generate completion report with metrics
7. Archive previous month's data
8. Log completion in audit trail
```
