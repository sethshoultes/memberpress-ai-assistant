## Next Steps

Immediate priority for the coming week:

1. Convert ASCII diagrams to final visual diagrams

This is the only remaining task for completing Phase 2 of the Documentation Improvement Plan. Once this task is complete, we can proceed to Phase 3: Developer Experience Enhancement.

## Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Impact | Solution |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Limited existing visual assets | Delays creation of examples | Creating new visual assets as we develop guides |
| Determining optimal screenshot resolution | Consistency issues | Establishing clear standards in the Screenshot Guide |
| Balancing detail vs. clarity in diagrams | User comprehension | Testing different approaches with sample user group |

## Resources Needed

To continue making progress, the following resources are needed:

- Access to design software for creating diagram templates
- Input from subject matter experts on key user workflows
- Sample user feedback on initial guides

## Conclusion

Phase 2 implementation is proceeding according to plan with 15% overall completion. The foundational visual style guide has been established, and user documentation has begun with the creation of the End-User Quick Start Guide. Focus will now shift to developing diagram templates and expanding user documentation.
