## Terms

### Agent

A specialized AI component designed to handle specific types of tasks or domains. Agents use natural language processing capabilities to understand and respond to user requests within their area of expertise.

**Example:** The MemberPress Agent specializes in handling MemberPress-specific questions and commands.

**Related terms:** Agent Orchestrator, Base Agent, Specialized Agent

**See also:** [Comprehensive Agent System Guide](../agent-system/comprehensive-agent-system-guide.md)

### Agent Orchestrator

The central component that coordinates multiple specialized agents, routing requests to the most appropriate agent based on the content and context of the request.

**Related terms:** Agent, Agent Routing

**See also:** [Agent Orchestrator](../agent-system/comprehensive-agent-system-guide.md#agent-orchestrator)

### Agent Scoring

The process of evaluating which specialized agent is best suited to handle a specific user request based on confidence scores calculated for each agent.

**Example:** When processing a user request about MemberPress subscriptions, the Agent Scoring system would assign a high confidence score to the MemberPress Agent.

**See also:** [Agent Specialization Scoring](../../_snacks/agents/agent-specialization-scoring.md)

### API Router

A component that manages communication between the plugin and multiple AI providers (such as OpenAI and Anthropic), routing requests to the appropriate provider and handling fallbacks if necessary.

**Related terms:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Claude

**See also:** [API Router](../core/system-map.md#api-router)

### Chat Interface

The user interface that allows users to interact with the AI assistant through natural language conversations.

**Related terms:** Chat UI, Chat History

**See also:** [Chat Interface](../core/system-map.md#chat-interface)

### Command System

A subsystem that processes and executes WordPress and MemberPress commands issued through the AI assistant.

**Related terms:** Command Validation, Command Detection, Command Execution

**See also:** [Command System](../core/system-map.md#command-system)

### Content Marker System

A system that uses HTML comments to mark and identify different types of content generated by the AI assistant, facilitating accurate content retrieval and processing.

**Example:** `<!-- MPAI_CONTENT_MARKER:blog_post:2025-04-01T12:00:00Z -->`

**See also:** [Content Marker System](../content-system/CONTENT_MARKER_SYSTEM.md)

### Context Manager

A component that maintains the conversation context between the user and the AI assistant, including handling tool execution and managing conversation state.

**Related terms:** Conversation History, State Management

**See also:** [Context Manager](../core/system-map.md#context-manager)

### Error Recovery System

A system designed to handle errors gracefully, implementing retry mechanisms, fallbacks, and user-friendly error messages to maintain system stability.

**Related terms:** Error Handling, Fallback Mechanism

**See also:** [Error Recovery System](../error-system/error-recovery-system.md)

### Function Calling

A capability of modern AI models that allows the AI to request the execution of specific functions with structured parameters to perform tasks beyond text generation.

**Example:** When a user asks to create a new blog post, the AI uses function calling to invoke the appropriate WordPress API function with title, content, and other parameters.

**Related terms:** Tool Call, Tool Execution

### Independent Operation Mode

A feature that allows the MemberPress AI Assistant to function with limited capabilities even when the MemberPress plugin is not active or installed.

**See also:** [Independent Operation Implementation](../../archive/MEMBERPRESS_INDEPENDENT_OPERATION.md)

### MemberPress API

An internal API that provides a standardized interface for interacting with MemberPress functionality, abstracting the underlying implementation details.

**Related terms:** MemberPress Integration

**See also:** [MemberPress API](../core/system-map.md#memberpress-api)

### MPAI

Acronym for MemberPress AI Assistant, used as a prefix for class names, functions, and hooks throughout the codebase.

**Example:** `MPAI_Chat`, `mpai_process_message`, `mpai_tool_registry`

### Scooby Mode

An investigation mode triggered by specific phrases ("Scooby Mode", "Scooby Doo", "Scooby", "Jinkies") that shifts the assistant's behavior to a diagnostic approach focused on problem-solving.

**Related terms:** Scooby Snack, Investigation Protocol

**See also:** [Scooby Snack Protocol](../../_snacks/README.md)

### Scooby Snack

A documented solution to a problem or investigation, following a standardized format that includes the problem statement, investigation steps, solution, and lessons learned.
