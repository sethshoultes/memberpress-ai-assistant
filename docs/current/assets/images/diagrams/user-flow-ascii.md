## Process Description

1. **User Access and Question Input**:
   - User navigates to any MemberPress admin page
   - Clicks on AI Assistant chat icon
   - Types natural language question or command
   - Submits query with "Send" button or Enter key

2. **Input Processing**:
   - Interface captures input
   - Performs input validation and sanitization
   - Determines query intent and category
   - Routes to appropriate handler

3. **Context Enhancement**:
   - System retrieves relevant MemberPress data
   - Adds membership statistics, user data, or settings
   - Enriches prompt with system information
   - Formats context for AI consumption

4. **AI Service Processing**:
   - Enhanced prompt sent to configured AI service
   - Service generates response
   - Response is validated for safety and relevance
   - Cache checked for similar previous queries

5. **Response Delivery**:
   - Response formatted with markdown
   - Rendered in chat interface
   - Interactive elements added if applicable
   - Response cached for future similar queries

## Notes for Final Diagram

- Use color-coded arrows to indicate data flow direction
- Include timing estimates at each stage
- Add user avatar and assistant avatar for dialogue representation
- Show interface state transitions with screenshots
- Include loading indicator animation
- Consider showing alternative flows (error handling, etc.)
- Include sample queries and responses in speech bubbles
