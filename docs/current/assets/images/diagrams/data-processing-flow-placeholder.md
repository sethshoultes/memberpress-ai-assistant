# Data Processing Flow Diagram - Visual Placeholder

This document serves as a placeholder for the final visual Data Processing Flow Diagram.

## Diagram Description

The Data Processing Flow Diagram will illustrate how data moves through the MemberPress AI Assistant system, showing:

- Data sources and origins
- Processing transformations
- Data enrichment steps
- Analytics and insight generation
- Storage mechanisms
- Output formatting

## Source Reference

This diagram will be created based on the ASCII version located here:
[Data Processing Flow ASCII](data-processing-flow-ascii.md)

## Expected Visual Elements

The final diagram will include:

- Data source shapes with distinctive styling
- Process boxes for transformation steps
- Data store representations
- Labeled data flows with types
- Hierarchical layout showing data journey
- Input/output relationships

## Status and Timeline

- **Status**: Awaiting conversion

- **Format**: PNG (primary), SVG (secondary)
- **Resolution**: 300dpi with transparent background

## Implementation Notes

Once the visual diagram is created, this placeholder file will be removed, and the PNG file will be stored in this directory with the name `data-processing-flow.png`. Documentation references will be updated to point to the new visual diagram.
