# Visual Diagram Conversion Plan

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-04-06  
**Status:** üöß In Progress  
**Audience:** üë©‚Äçüíª Developers  
**Difficulty:** üü° Intermediate

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for converting the ASCII diagram placeholders into final visual diagrams using the standardized templates. The conversion process will ensure consistent styling, proper representation of system components, and alignment with the Visual Documentation Style Guide.

## Conversion Priorities

The diagrams will be converted in the following priority order:

1. **System Architecture Diagram** - Provides the foundational overview of the MemberPress AI Assistant system
2. **User Interaction Flow Diagram** - Illustrates the core user experience
3. **Component Relationships Diagram** - Shows interconnections between system parts
4. **Data Processing Flow Diagram** - Details how data moves through the system

## Conversion Process

Each ASCII diagram will be converted following these steps:

1. **Review ASCII Source**
   - Analyze the ASCII diagram structure
   - Note all components and relationships
   - Understand the intended visualization

2. **Template Selection**
   - Choose the appropriate diagram template type
   - Prepare template file in chosen diagramming software
   - Configure template with MemberPress colors and styles

3. **Component Creation**
   - Create each component using proper shapes
   - Apply consistent styling (colors, fonts, borders)
   - Add appropriate icons where helpful

4. **Relationship Mapping**
   - Draw connections between components
   - Label relationships accurately
   - Use proper arrow styles for relationships

5. **Visual Enhancement**
   - Add subtle shadows for depth
   - Apply consistent spacing
   - Ensure proper alignment of elements
   - Add visual hierarchy through sizing and positioning

6. **Verification**
   - Compare to original ASCII diagram for accuracy
   - Ensure all components and relationships are represented
   - Verify consistency with other diagrams
   - Check against Visual Documentation Style Guide

7. **Export & Integration**
   - Export in PNG format at 300dpi with transparent background
   - Save SVG version for potential future edits
   - Store source file in appropriate directory
   - Update documentation references to use new diagram

## Diagram-Specific Requirements

### System Architecture Diagram

- **Source**: [System Architecture ASCII](system-architecture-ascii.md)
- **Template**: Architecture Diagram Template
- **Special Considerations**:
  - Emphasize the layered structure of the system
  - Highlight external service connections
  - Use consistent component sizing for elements at the same level
  - Include WordPress environment container
  - Consider using small icons for key components

### User Interaction Flow Diagram

- **Source**: [User Flow ASCII](user-flow-ascii.md)
- **Template**: Flow Diagram Template + Sequence Diagram Elements
- **Special Considerations**:
  - Show clear timeline progression
  - Visualize both UI states and processing states
  - Include estimated timing indicators
  - Add user and system boundaries
  - Consider adding small UI mockups at key points

### Component Relationships Diagram

- **Source**: [Component Relationships ASCII](component-relationships-ascii.md)
- **Template**: Component Relationship Template
- **Special Considerations**:
  - Maintain balanced layout
  - Group related components
  - Use consistent relationship line styles
  - Add small annotations for complex relationships
  - Consider color-coding component types

### Data Processing Flow Diagram

- **Source**: [Data Processing Flow ASCII](data-processing-flow-ascii.md)
- **Template**: Data Flow Diagram Template
- **Special Considerations**:
  - Use distinct shapes for different data element types
  - Show data transformations clearly
  - Add small data previews at key points
  - Consider using callouts for important processes
  - Add legends for data type indicators

## Tools and Resources

### Recommended Software

- **Primary**: Draw.io / diagrams.net (free, web-based or desktop)
- **Alternative 1**: Lucidchart (professional, subscription-based)
- **Alternative 2**: Microsoft Visio (enterprise option)

### Resource Locations

- **Templates**: `/assets/templates/`
- **Source Files**: `/assets/images/diagrams/source/`
- **Final PNGs**: `/assets/images/diagrams/`
- **Style Guide**: `/core/visual-documentation-style-guide.md`

## Timeline and Assignment

| Diagram | Assigned To | Due Date | Status |
|---------|-------------|----------|--------|
| System Architecture | Visual Designer | April 8, 2025 | üöß In Progress |
| User Interaction Flow | Visual Designer | April 9, 2025 | üìÖ Scheduled |
| Component Relationships | Visual Designer | April 10, 2025 | üìÖ Scheduled |
| Data Processing Flow | Visual Designer | April 11, 2025 | üìÖ Scheduled |

## Approval Process

Each completed diagram will go through the following approval process:

1. Initial review by documentation lead
2. Technical accuracy verification by development team
3. Visual consistency check by design team
4. Final approval
5. Integration into documentation

## Next Steps

1. Finalize visual designer assignment
2. Set up shared repository for collaboration
3. Schedule check-in meetings for progress review
4. Prepare for integration into Phase 3 documentation
