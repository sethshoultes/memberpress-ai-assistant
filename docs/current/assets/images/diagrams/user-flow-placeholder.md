# User Interaction Flow Diagram - Visual Placeholder

This document serves as a placeholder for the final visual User Interaction Flow Diagram.

## Diagram Description

The User Interaction Flow Diagram will illustrate the sequence of interactions between the user, the AI Assistant interface, and backend services, showing:

- User input sequence
- Query processing flow
- AI service communication
- Response generation and display
- UI state transitions
- Timing estimates for each stage

## Source Reference

This diagram will be created based on the ASCII version located here:
[User Flow ASCII](user-flow-ascii.md)

## Expected Visual Elements

The final diagram will include:

- User and system components with distinct styling
- Sequential flow arrows with numbering
- Time progression indicators
- UI state representations
- Process boxes for backend operations
- Response path visualization

## Status and Timeline

- **Status**: Awaiting conversion
- **Expected Completion**: April 9, 2025
- **Format**: PNG (primary), SVG (secondary)
- **Resolution**: 300dpi with transparent background

## Implementation Notes

Once the visual diagram is created, this placeholder file will be removed, and the PNG file will be stored in this directory with the name `user-interaction-flow.png`. Documentation references will be updated to point to the new visual diagram.
