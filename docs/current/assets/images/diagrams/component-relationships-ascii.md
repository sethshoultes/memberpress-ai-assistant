## Notes for Final Diagram

- Use consistent color coding for component types:
  - Core systems (blue)
  - Integration layers (green)
  - Processing components (orange)
  - UI components (purple)
- Show data flow direction with arrows
- Indicate synchronous vs. asynchronous connections
- Add component version dependencies
- Include primary interfaces between components
- Show optional vs. required relationships
- Consider using line thickness to indicate relationship strength/importance
