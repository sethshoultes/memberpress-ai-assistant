# Diagram Documentation

This directory contains both ASCII diagram placeholders and the finalized visual diagrams for the MemberPress AI Assistant documentation. The ASCII diagrams serve as detailed references for creating the final visual representations.

## Diagram Conversion Status

## Available ASCII Diagrams

1. **[System Architecture](system-architecture-ascii.md)**
   - Overview of the MemberPress AI Assistant architecture
   - Shows major components and their relationships
   - Illustrates data flow through the system

2. **[User Interaction Flow](user-flow-ascii.md)**
   - Depicts the sequence of events from user input to response
   - Shows interface states throughout the interaction
   - Includes timing estimates

3. **[Data Processing Flow](data-processing-flow-ascii.md)**
   - Details how membership data is processed and analyzed
   - Shows the data transformation pipeline
   - Illustrates the analytics and insight generation process

4. **[Component Relationships](component-relationships-ascii.md)**
   - Maps the relationships between plugin components
   - Shows dependencies and interactions
   - Highlights integration points with other systems

## Conversion Plan

The conversion from ASCII diagrams to final visual diagrams follows the process defined in the [Visual Diagram Conversion Plan](visual-diagram-conversion-plan.md). This plan outlines:

- Priority order for diagram conversion
- Detailed conversion steps
- Diagram-specific requirements
- Tools and resources
- Timeline and assignments
- Approval process

## Using These Diagrams

These diagrams serve different purposes in the documentation lifecycle:

1. **ASCII Diagrams**:
   - Provide detailed technical specifications
   - Serve as reference for component relationships
   - Include comprehensive descriptions

2. **Visual Diagrams**:
   - Provide clear visual representation for documentation
   - Follow consistent visual styling
   - Enhance understanding through visual design

When using these diagrams in documentation:

- Reference the final visual diagrams in user-facing documentation
- Use ASCII diagrams for developer reference and technical details
- Follow the guidelines in the [Visual Documentation Style Guide](../../core/visual-documentation-style-guide.md)

## Creating New Diagrams

When creating new diagrams:

1. Start with an ASCII representation for technical accuracy
2. Include a detailed overview explaining the diagram's purpose
3. Add comprehensive component descriptions
4. Follow the established diagram templates 
5. Create the visual version following the style guide
6. Include both versions in the repository

## Diagram Naming Conventions

- ASCII References: `[topic]-ascii.md`
- Visual Placeholders: `[topic]-placeholder.md`
- Final Diagrams: `[topic].png`

All diagrams should follow the standardized diagram templates found in the [templates directory](../../assets/templates/).
