# MemberPress AI Assistant - Error Handling Systems

**Status:** âœ… Maintained  
**Version:** 1.6.1  
**Last Updated:** April 5, 2025

This directory contains documentation for the error handling, recovery, and validation systems in the MemberPress AI Assistant plugin.

## Components

- [**Error Recovery System**](error-recovery-system.md) - Core error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [**State Validation System**](state-validation-system.md) - System state consistency and validation
- [**Input Sanitization System**](input-sanitization-improvements.md) - Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- [**Error Catalog System**](/docs/current/MPAI_Error_Catalog_System.md) - Comprehensive error typing and catalog system

## Features

- **Error Recovery**:
  - Standardized error types and severity levels
  - Context-rich error objects with detailed information
  - Configurable recovery strategies for different error types
  - Circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
  - User-friendly error messages

- **State Validation**:
  - System invariant verification
  - Pre/post condition framework for operations
  - Component state monitoring with consistency checks
  - Validation rules for core components
  - Assertion framework for state verification

- **Input Sanitization**:
  - Schema-based validation for all parameter types
  - Integration with OpenAI/Anthropic function calling
  - Type enforcement and range validation
  - Automatic sanitization for security
  - Detailed error reporting for invalid inputs

- **Error Catalog and Logging**:
  - Performance-optimized logging
  - Structured error code system
  - Advanced debugging capabilities
  - Log management interface
  - Automated retention management

## Integration Points

These error systems integrate with key plugin components:

- **API Router** - For handling API failures, provider fallback, and state validation
- **Context Manager** - For tool execution error handling and operation validation
- **Agent Orchestrator** - For agent-related error handling and state monitoring
- **Tool Registry** - For tool validation and invariant verification
- **JavaScript Console Logger** - For client-side error reporting

## Tests

Error and validation system tests can be run using:

1. **Error Recovery Tests**:
   - The built-in test in Settings > Diagnostic tab
   - Direct test page at `/test/test-error-recovery-page.php`
   - Simplified direct test at `/test/test-error-recovery-direct.php`

2. **State Validation Tests**:
   - Run the test page at `/test/test-state-validation.php`
   - Includes 15 validation tests for all system components
   - Verifies invariants, component validation, and state monitoring

3. **Integration Tests**:
   - Error recovery and state validation are included in the Tool Execution Integration Tests
   - Both systems are verified in end-to-end tests through the diagnostic interface
