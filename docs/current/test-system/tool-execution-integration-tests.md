# Tool Execution Integration Tests

**Status:** ✅ Implemented  
**Version:** 1.6.1  
**Last Updated:** April 5, 2025  
**Category:** Testing

This document describes the Tool Execution Integration Tests implemented for Phase Three of the MemberPress AI Assistant project.

## Overview

Tool Execution Integration Tests provide comprehensive end-to-end testing for various tools within the MemberPress AI Assistant. These tests verify that tools function correctly with WordPress and external systems under real-world conditions.

The tests focus on:
1. Testing tool initialization and parameter handling
2. Verifying expected outputs and error handling
3. Ensuring proper integration with WordPress and MemberPress APIs
4. Edge case handling

## Implementation

The integration tests are implemented as part of the Phase Three Testing & Stability Enhancement Plan.

### File Structure

```
test/integration/
├── register-integration-tests.php    # Main registration file
├── diagnostics-section.php           # Adds diagnostic section to settings page
├── test-tool-execution.php           # Orchestrates running all tool tests
└── tools/
    ├── test-wpcli-tool.php           # Tests for WP-CLI tool
    ├── test-wp-api-tool.php          # Tests for WordPress API tool
    └── test-plugin-logs-tool.php     # Tests for Plugin Logs tool
```

### Tools Tested

#### 1. WP-CLI Tool Tests (12 tests)
- Tool instance creation and properties
- Parameter validation
- Command execution
- Error handling
- Caching mechanism
- Security validation

#### 2. WordPress API Tool Tests (12 tests)
- Tool instance creation and properties
- Parameter validation
- WordPress API integration
- Post/page management
- User management
- Plugin activation/deactivation
- MemberPress integration

#### 3. Plugin Logs Tool Tests (12 tests)
- Tool instance creation and properties
- Parameter handling
- Database integration
- Data formatting
- Filtering capabilities
- Result organization

## Running Tests

The integration tests can be run from two locations:

1. **System Diagnostics Page**: From the MemberPress AI Assistant settings, open the "Diagnostics" tab and click "Run Tool Integration Tests" to run tests directly in the admin interface.

2. **Integration Tests Page**: Navigate to MemberPress AI → Integration Tests in the admin menu to access a dedicated page with more detailed test results.

## Test Results Display

Test results are displayed in an expandable accordion interface with:
- Overall test status (passed/failed)
- Summary statistics for each tool
- Detailed test results with failure messages
- Categories for better organization

## Adding New Tests

To add new integration tests:

1. Create a new test file in the `test/integration/tools/` directory
2. Define test functions that return properly structured results
3. Add the test to the execution flow in `test-tool-execution.php`

## Integration with System Diagnostics

The tests are fully integrated with the System Diagnostics page using:
- WordPress action hooks (`mpai_run_diagnostics`)
- AJAX handlers for asynchronous test execution
- Output buffering for clean HTML capture

## Benefits

- **Improved Stability**: Regularly running these tests helps identify integration issues early
- **Higher Code Quality**: Test-driven development for tool implementations
- **Better Debugging**: Clear error messages for troubleshooting
- **User Confidence**: Visible verification that tools work as expected

## Next Steps

- Expand tests to cover additional tools as they are developed
- Create automated test runs for continuous integration
- Develop performance benchmarks within the test suite
- Add regression testing capabilities
