# Documentation Images

This directory contains images used in the documentation. The following image files would typically be included:

- `api-settings.png` - Screenshot of the API settings page
- `cli-settings.png` - Screenshot of the CLI command settings page
- `chat-interface.png` - Screenshot of the admin chat interface
- `test-bot.png` - Screenshot of the test bot interface

When implementing the plugin in a production environment, these placeholder descriptions should be replaced with actual screenshots of the user interface.

## Creating Screenshots

To create high-quality screenshots for documentation:

1. Use a clean WordPress installation with default theme
2. Configure the plugin with test data
3. Use a screen capture tool to take screenshots
4. Crop screenshots to focus on the relevant interface elements
5. Optimize images for web (PNG format recommended for interface screenshots)
6. Size images appropriately (800-1200px width recommended)
7. Add arrows or highlights to draw attention to specific features

## Image Naming Conventions

Use consistent naming conventions for documentation images:

- Descriptive: The name should describe the content
- Hyphenated: Use hyphens to separate words
- Lowercase: Use all lowercase for filenames
- Versioned: For major UI changes, consider adding version numbers
