# Implementation Progress Report

This document summarizes the progress made in implementing the code cleanup recommendations for the MemberPress AI Assistant plugin.

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Tool ID Standardization

- ✅ Verified that the Command Validation Agent already has code to handle legacy tool IDs properly
- ✅ Verified that the AJAX Handler already rejects requests using legacy tool IDs with appropriate error messages
- ✅ Verified that the WP-CLI tool implementation is consistent with these changes
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation for the WP-CLI tool implementation in `docs/developer/wpcli-tool-implementation.md`

### Phase 2: Code Refactoring

- ✅ Moved test files to the tests directory:
  - ✅ Created `tests/cli` directory
  - ✅ Moved `includes/cli/test-wpcli-command.php` to `tests/cli/test-wpcli-command.php`
  - ✅ Created `tests/tools` directory for future test files

## Remaining Tasks

### Phase 2: Code Refactoring (Continued)

- ✅ Created a unified approach to tool call detection that works consistently across JavaScript and PHP:
  - ✅ Created `includes/detection/class-mpai-tool-call-detector.php` for PHP implementation
  - ✅ Created `assets/js/modules/mpai-tool-call-detector.js` for JavaScript implementation
  - ✅ Updated `includes/detection/load.php` to load the new tool call detector class
- ✅ Created a unified approach to agent specialization scoring that can be reused across different agents:
  - ✅ Created `includes/agents/class-mpai-agent-scoring.php` for centralized scoring logic
  - ✅ Updated `includes/agents/class-mpai-base-agent.php` to use the new scoring system
  - ✅ Updated `includes/agents/class-mpai-agent-orchestrator.php` to use the new scoring system
  - ✅ Created `includes/agents/load.php` to load the agent system components
  - ✅ Updated `memberpress-ai-assistant.php` to use the new agent system loader
- ⬜ Audit JavaScript and CSS files to identify unused files and remove them
- ⬜ Standardize naming conventions across the codebase
- ⬜ Improve error handling across the codebase
- ⬜ Improve documentation across the codebase

### Phase 3: Testing

- ⬜ Write unit tests for the refactored code
- ⬜ Test the plugin with different WordPress versions
- ⬜ Test the plugin with different PHP versions
- ⬜ Test the plugin with different browsers
- ⬜ Test the plugin with different MemberPress versions
- ⬜ Test the plugin with different API providers (OpenAI and Anthropic)
- ⬜ Test the plugin with different user roles and permissions

### Phase 4: Documentation Update

- ⬜ Update the documentation to reflect the changes made in Phase 1 and Phase 2
- ⬜ Add examples and tutorials for common tasks
- ⬜ Create a changelog to document the changes

### Phase 5: Release

- ⬜ Create a release candidate
- ⬜ Perform final testing
- ⬜ Create a release package
- ⬜ Update the plugin in the WordPress repository

## Next Steps

1. Continue with Phase 2: Code Refactoring
   - ✅ Created a unified approach to tool call detection
   - ✅ Created a unified approach to agent specialization scoring
   - Audit JavaScript and CSS files to identify unused files
   - Standardize naming conventions across the codebase

2. Begin Phase 3: Testing
   - Write unit tests for the refactored code
   - Set up test environments for different WordPress and PHP versions

3. Continue updating documentation as changes are made

## Notes

- The `test-tool-execution.php` file mentioned in the code cleanup recommendations was not found in the includes/tools directory. It might have been removed already or it might be in a different location.
- The _archives/_removed_files directory mentioned in the original task could not be accessed from the current working directory.
