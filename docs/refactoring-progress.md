- [x] Verify each file's usage
- [x] Categorize files by system/component
- [ ] Mark files for archiving

### Duplicated Code Mapping
- [x] Identify MemberPress detection duplications
- [x] Map settings page implementations
- [x] Document logger implementations
- [x] Identify diagnostic system duplications

## Planned Phases

### Phase 2: Prioritized Refactoring (In Progress)
- [x] Settings System Consolidation
  - [x] Created unified settings manager (`class-mpai-unified-settings-manager.php`)
  - [x] Created unified settings page (`unified-settings-page.php`) 
  - [x] Created integration plan for main plugin (`integration-plan.md`)
  - [x] Updated main plugin to use unified settings manager
  - [x] Added settings migration function
  - [x] Implemented backward compatibility
- [x] Diagnostic System Standardization
  - [x] Created unified diagnostics manager class (`class-mpai-diagnostic-manager.php`)
  - [x] Created diagnostic tests interface (`interface-mpai-diagnostic-test.php`)
  - [x] Implemented essential diagnostic tests (`tests/class-mpai-*.php`)
  - [x] Created unified diagnostics page UI (`class-mpai-unified-diagnostics-page.php`)
  - [x] Updated main plugin to integrate diagnostics system (`load-diagnostics.php`)
- [x] Logger Consolidation
  - [x] Created logger interface (`interface-mpai-logger.php`)
  - [x] Implemented abstract logger class (`class-mpai-abstract-logger.php`)
  - [x] Created concrete logger implementations (error_log, file, db, null)
  - [x] Implemented logger manager singleton (`class-mpai-logger-manager.php`)
  - [x] Created global logging functions (`mpai-logging-functions.php`)
  - [x] Added utility for replacing error_log calls (`replace-error-log.php`)
  - [x] Updated main plugin to use unified logger system
  - [x] Created logger system documentation
- [x] MemberPress Detection Unification
  - [x] Created MemberPress detector class (`class-mpai-memberpress-detector.php`)
  - [x] Implemented caching for performance
  - [x] Added detection method tracking
  - [x] Created global helper functions
  - [x] Integrated with main plugin
  - [x] Updated admin menu detection
  - [x] Updated MemberPress API integration
  - [x] Added filter for forcing detection
  - [x] Created detection system documentation

### Phase 3: Final Integration
- [ ] Move deprecated settings files to archive directory
- [ ] Update all components to use the new unified systems
- [ ] Improve test coverage for refactored components
- [ ] Update documentation with new architecture details
- [ ] Implement consistent logging interface
- [ ] Standardize diagnostic tools
- [ ] Create centralized MemberPress detection

### Phase 4: Cleanup and Documentation
- [ ] Move deprecated files to archive directories
- [ ] Update component dependencies
- [ ] Update developer documentation
- [ ] Add inline documentation for new components

## Progress Details

### Unused Files Inventory (In Progress)

The following files have been identified as potentially unused or deprecated:

#### Archive Directories
- `/includes/archive/` - Contains older versions of core components
- `/assets/archive/` - Contains deprecated JavaScript and CSS
- `/docs/archive/` - Contains outdated documentation

#### Specific Deprecated Files
- `/includes/archive/class-mpai-diagnostics-page.php` - Older diagnostics implementation
- `/includes/archive/class-mpai-settings-manager.php` - Older settings system
- `/includes/archive/class-mpai-wpcli-tool.php.old` - Previous WP-CLI implementation

#### Settings System Duplicates
- `/includes/archive/settings-page-new.php`
- `/includes/archive/settings-page-simple.php` 
- `/includes/archive/settings-page-v2.php`
- Current implementation in `/includes/settings-page.php`

#### Missing Tool Implementations
- Referenced in Tool Registry but don't exist:
  - `class-mpai-content-generator-tool.php`
  - `class-mpai-analytics-tool.php`

### Settings System Consolidation (Not Started)

**Target Implementation:**
```php
/**
 * Unified Settings Manager for MemberPress AI Assistant
 * 
 * Provides centralized access to plugin settings with support
 * for backward compatibility with previous implementations.
 *
 * @since 1.7.0
 */
class MPAI_Settings_Manager {
    // Implementation details to be added
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Complete the inventory of unused files
2. Map all duplicated code with specific file references
3. Begin implementation of unified settings manager
4. Plan standardized approach for diagnostic system

## Notes

- Need to maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Some duplicated code may be intentional for redundancy/fallbacks
- Setting system consolidation is highest priority due to its central role
