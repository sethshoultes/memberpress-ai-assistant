## Why These Documents Are Archived

1. **Completed Projects:** All implementation plans have been executed and their objectives achieved
2. **Obsolete Functionality:** Some documents relate to the consent system, which has been completely removed from the plugin
3. **Historical Value:** These documents provide valuable context about the development process and decisions made
4. **Reference Material:** Future developers can understand past architectural decisions and implementation approaches
5. **Project Documentation:** Complete record of major development phases and maintenance activities
6. **Clean Documentation:** Archival maintains focus on current, actionable documentation in the main docs directory

## Document Status

All archived documents are marked with **ARCHIVED DOCUMENT** headers indicating:
- Archive date
- Reason for archival
- Historical context
- Original content preservation

## Recovery Guidelines
