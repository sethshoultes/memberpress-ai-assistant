## Problem Statement

AI responses containing tool calls would sometimes result in the same tool being executed multiple times, causing duplicate operations, API quota issues, and in some cases data inconsistencies. This was particularly problematic with content creation tools where duplicate posts could be created from a single request.

### Symptoms

1. Duplicate log entries for the same tool execution
2. Multiple identical posts/pages being created
3. Excessive API calls to external services
4. Higher than expected resource utilization

## Investigation Process

1. **Reproducing the issue**:
   - Created a test case where the AI would generate a response with tool calls
   - Observed that some tools were being executed multiple times
   - Logging showed duplicate execution paths through the system

2. **Code review**:
   - Examined the tool call detection and execution logic in `MPAI_Chat::process_message()`
   - Found that both `process_tool_calls()` and `process_structured_tool_calls()` could process the same tool calls
   - Discovered that regex pattern matching was capturing the same tool calls multiple times

3. **Pattern analysis**:
   - Analyzed AI responses from both OpenAI and Anthropic
   - Identified different formats for tool calls between API providers
   - Found inconsistencies in how tool calls were being detected and processed

4. **Data flow tracing**:
   - Traced the complete execution path from user input to tool execution
   - Identified three separate points where tool call execution could be triggered
   - Found that tool ids and execution parameters were not being tracked for uniqueness

## Root Cause Analysis

The root cause was found to be multi-faceted:

1. **Overlapping detection methods**:
   - The system had both regex-based and structured JSON-based tool call detection
   - Both methods were processing the same tool calls independently
   - No mechanism existed to track which tool calls had already been executed

2. **Regex pattern issues**:
   - Overly greedy regex patterns sometimes captured multiple tool calls as a single match
   - Regex patterns didn't properly handle nested JSON structures
   - Tool call detection wasn't respecting code block boundaries

3. **Lack of deduplication**:
   - No unique identifiers for tool calls to track execution status
   - No caching or tracking of previously executed tool calls
   - No validation to compare new tool calls against recently executed ones

## Solution Implemented

The solution involved several key components:

1. **Tool call tracking system**:
   - Added a unique identifier for each tool call based on tool name and parameters hash
   - Implemented a cache to track recently executed tool calls
   - Added validation to prevent re-execution of identical tool calls

```php
/**
 * Check if a tool call is a duplicate
 *
 * @param string $tool_id Tool ID
 * @param array $parameters Tool parameters
 * @return boolean Whether the tool call is a duplicate
 */
private function is_duplicate_tool_call($tool_id, $parameters) {
    // Generate a unique hash for this tool call
    $hash = md5($tool_id . json_encode($parameters));
    
    // Check if this hash exists in our recently executed tools
    if (isset($this->recent_tool_calls[$hash])) {
        error_log('MPAI: Prevented duplicate execution of tool: ' . $tool_id);
        return true;
    }
    
    // Not a duplicate, add to recent calls
    $this->recent_tool_calls[$hash] = time();
    
    // Cleanup old entries (older than 60 seconds)
    foreach ($this->recent_tool_calls as $h => $timestamp) {
        if (time() - $timestamp > 60) {
            unset($this->recent_tool_calls[$h]);
        }
    }
    
    return false;
}
```

2. **Improved detection logic**:
   - Prioritized structured tool calls over regex-based detection
   - Enhanced regex patterns to be more precise and respect boundaries
   - Added additional validation checks before tool execution

3. **Unified execution path**:
   - Centralized tool execution through a single method
   - Added logging to track tool execution attempts
   - Implemented proper error handling for duplicate detection

4. **AI prompt updates**:
   - Updated AI system prompts to encourage consistent tool call formatting
   - Added specific instructions about preferred tool call formats
   - Included examples of proper tool usage

## Lessons Learned

1. **AI response variability**: Different AI models and even the same model across different calls can format tool calls differently. Systems must be robust to these variations.

2. **Idempotency matters**: Tool execution should be designed to be idempotent when possible, so even if duplicate calls occur, the system remains consistent.

3. **Unique tracking**: Each operation should have a unique identifier or signature that can be used to prevent duplication.

4. **Defensive processing**: Always assume that pattern matching and AI response processing might have edge cases and build in appropriate safeguards.

5. **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed logs of tool execution, including parameters and results, are essential for debugging complex interaction issues.
