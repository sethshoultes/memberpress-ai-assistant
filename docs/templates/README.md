| [Reference Documentation](reference-template.md) | Detailed technical reference | For comprehensive technical references of components, APIs, or classes |
| [Tutorial](tutorial-template.md) | Step-by-step instructions | For creating tutorials that walk users through a specific process |
| [Guide](guide-template.md) | Comprehensive topic overview | For in-depth exploration of a topic or concept |
