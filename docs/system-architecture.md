# System Architecture Overview

## Introduction

The MemberPress AI Assistant is built on a modular, extensible architecture that combines several architectural patterns to create a robust, maintainable system. This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture, explaining how the various components work together.

## Architectural Patterns

The MemberPress AI Assistant implements several architectural patterns:

1. **Layered Architecture**: The system is organized into layers with clear responsibilities
2. **Dependency Injection**: Components receive their dependencies rather than creating them
3. **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Functionality is provided through discrete services
4. **Agent-Based Architecture**: Specialized agents handle different types of requests
5. **Tool-Based Architecture**: Operations are implemented as tools with standardized interfaces
6. **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: User interface components follow the MVC pattern

## System Layers

The system is organized into the following layers:

### Presentation Layer

The presentation layer handles user interaction and display:

- **Admin Interface**: WordPress admin pages and settings
- **Chat Interface**: Conversational UI for interacting with the AI
- **Templates**: Reusable UI components

### Application Layer

The application layer contains the core business logic:

- **Agent System**: Specialized AI agents for different domains
- **Tool System**: Reusable operations with standardized interfaces
- **Orchestration**: Coordination between agents and tools
- **Services**: Business logic and integration with external systems

### Infrastructure Layer

The infrastructure layer provides supporting functionality:

- **Dependency Injection**: Component creation and wiring
- **Caching**: Performance optimization
- **Logging**: Error tracking and debugging
- **Configuration**: System settings and preferences

### Integration Layer

The integration layer connects to external systems:

- **MemberPress Integration**: Connection to MemberPress functionality
- **WordPress Integration**: Integration with WordPress core
- **AI Provider Integration**: Connection to OpenAI and Anthropic APIs

## Core Components

### Agent System

The agent system provides specialized AI assistants for different domains:

1. **Agent Interface**: Defines the contract for all agents
2. **Abstract Agent**: Base implementation with common functionality
3. **Agent Orchestrator**: Selects the appropriate agent for each request
4. **Agent Factory**: Creates agent instances with dependencies
5. **Agent Registry**: Maintains a registry of available agents

For more details, see the [Agent Architecture](agent-architecture.md) documentation.

### Tool System

The tool system provides reusable operations with standardized interfaces:

1. **Tool Interface**: Defines the contract for all tools
2. **Abstract Tool**: Base implementation with common functionality
3. **Tool Registry**: Maintains a registry of available tools
4. **Cached Tool Wrapper**: Provides caching for tool operations

For more details, see the [Available Tools](available-tools.md) documentation.

### Service Layer

The service layer provides business logic and integration with external systems:

1. **Service Interface**: Defines the contract for all services
2. **Abstract Service**: Base implementation with common functionality
3. **Service Registrar**: Registers services with the dependency injection container
4. **Specialized Services**: Implement specific business logic

Key services include:

### Dependency Injection

The dependency injection system manages component creation and dependencies:

1. **Container**: Full-featured DI container with automatic resolution
2. **Service Locator**: Simpler service location with lazy loading
3. **Factory Classes**: Create instances of specific component types

For more details, see the [Dependency Injection](dependency-injection.md) documentation.

## Component Interactions

### Request Flow

When a user interacts with the system, the request flows through the following components:

1. **User Interface**: Captures user input (chat message, admin action)
2. **Controller**: Processes the input and delegates to appropriate services
3. **Service**: Implements business logic and coordinates with other components
4. **Agent Orchestrator**: Selects the appropriate agent for the request
5. **Agent**: Processes the request using specialized knowledge
6. **Tools**: Perform specific operations requested by the agent
7. **Service**: Collects results and prepares response
8. **Controller**: Formats response for display
9. **User Interface**: Displays response to the user

### Data Flow

Data flows through the system in the following manner:

1. **Input**: User input is captured and validated
2. **Transformation**: Input is transformed into a standardized format
3. **Processing**: Business logic is applied to the data
4. **Storage**: Results are stored if necessary
5. **Retrieval**: Data is retrieved from storage when needed
6. **Presentation**: Data is formatted for display
7. **Output**: Results are presented to the user

## System Modules

For more details, see the [Membership Operations](membership-operations.md) and [User Integration](user-integration.md) documentation.

### AI Integration Module

The AI integration module connects to AI providers:

- **OpenAI Integration**: Connects to OpenAI API
- **Anthropic Integration**: Connects to Anthropic API
- **Model Configuration**: Configures AI models
- **Request Builder**: Builds API requests
- **Response Parser**: Parses API responses

## File Structure
