# MemberPress AI Assistant Documentation

Welcome to the MemberPress AI Assistant documentation hub. This directory contains comprehensive documentation organized by implementation status and purpose. For new developers, please see the [_0_START_HERE_.md](../_0_START_HERE_.md) and [_1_AGENTIC_SYSTEMS_.md](../_1_AGENTIC_SYSTEMS_.md) files in the project root for the most up-to-date developer guidance.

See our [Documentation Consolidation Plan](./DOCUMENTATION_PLAN.md) for information about ongoing documentation improvements. Phase 1 of this plan has been completed ([documentation-consolidation-results.md](current/documentation-consolidation-results.md)), and Phase 2 is now in progress.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into four main categories:

- [**Current Features**](current/) - Documentation for implemented and active features
- [**XML Content System**](xml-content-system/) - Comprehensive documentation for the XML content formatting system
- [**Feature Roadmap**](roadmap/) - Documentation for features in planning or development
- [**Archive**](archive/) - Historical documentation that has been superseded
