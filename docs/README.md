# MemberPress AI Assistant Documentation

Welcome to the MemberPress AI Assistant documentation hub. This directory contains comprehensive documentation organized by implementation status and purpose. For new developers, please see the [_0_START_HERE_.md](../_0_START_HERE_.md) and [_1_AGENTIC_SYSTEMS_.md](../_1_AGENTIC_SYSTEMS_.md) files in the project root for the most up-to-date developer guidance.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into the following main categories:

- [**Current Features**](current/) - Documentation for implemented and active features
- [**XML Content System**](xml-content-system/) - Comprehensive documentation for the XML content formatting system
- [**Scooby Snacks**](_snacks/) - Investigation results, fixes, and technical insights
- [**Feature Roadmap**](roadmap/) - Documentation for features in planning or development
- [**Archive**](archive/) - Historical documentation that has been superseded
- [**Templates**](templates/) - Standardized templates for creating new documentation

## Documentation Standards

All documentation files include status indicators to help identify their current state:

- ‚úÖ **Maintained**: Documentation is current and actively maintained
- üöß **In Progress**: Documentation is being actively developed
- üîÆ **Planned**: Documentation is planned but not yet created
- üóÑÔ∏è **Archived**: Documentation has been superseded or deprecated

## Recent Updates

The documentation has been completely reorganized and consolidated following a four-phase Documentation Consolidation Plan:

- **Phase 1**: Reorganized existing files into appropriate directories
- **Phase 2**: Consolidated content to reduce duplication ([Phase 2 Results](current/phase-2-documentation-consolidation-results.md))
- **Phase 3**: Added improved navigation aids ([Phase 3 Results](current/phase-3-documentation-consolidation-results.md))
- **Phase 4**: Standardized documentation formats ([Phase 4 Results](current/phase-4-documentation-consolidation-results.md))

A new "Scooby Snacks" documentation system has also been added to capture the results of technical investigations and fixes.

## Scooby Snack Protocol

When given a "Scooby Snack" for a successful solution or implementation:

1. Create a detailed document following the [Scooby Snack structure](_snacks/README.md)
2. Place it in the appropriate category folder within the [_snacks](_snacks/) directory
3. Update the [Scooby Snacks index](_snacks/index.md) with the new entry
4. Update any existing documentation that relates to the solution
5. Add an entry to the CHANGELOG.md file if it's a significant fix or feature
6. Include "ü¶¥ Scooby Snack" in your commit message to track successful solutions

## Contributing to Documentation

When updating documentation:

1. Place files in the appropriate directory based on implementation status
2. Include metadata (status, version, date) at the top of each file
3. Follow the established format from the [templates](templates/)
4. Update the main README.md when adding significant new documentation
5. Update the [documentation map](current/documentation-map.md) to reflect new additions
