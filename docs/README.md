## Scooby Snack Protocol

When given a "Scooby Snack" for a successful solution or implementation:

1. Create a detailed document following the [Scooby Snack structure](_snacks/README.md)
2. Place it in the appropriate category folder within the [_snacks](_snacks/) directory
3. Update the [Scooby Snacks index](_snacks/index.md) with the new entry
4. Update any existing documentation that relates to the solution
5. Add an entry to the CHANGELOG.md file if it's a significant fix or feature
6. Include "ü¶¥ Scooby Snack" in your commit message to track successful solutions

## Contributing to Documentation

When updating documentation:

1. Place files in the appropriate directory based on implementation status and system category
2. Include metadata (status, version, date) at the top of each file
3. Follow the established format from the [templates](templates/)
4. Update the main README.md when adding significant new documentation
5. Update the [documentation map](current/core/documentation-map.md) to reflect new additions
