# Agent System Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Agent System in the MemberPress AI Assistant plugin.

## Introduction

The Agent System is a core component of the MemberPress AI Assistant plugin that provides specialized AI capabilities for different types of tasks. It allows the AI assistant to route requests to specialized agents based on the user's intent, ensuring that each request is handled by the most appropriate agent.

## Architecture

The Agent System consists of several components:

### Agent Orchestrator

The Agent Orchestrator is the central component of the Agent System. It is responsible for:

- Registering agents
- Analyzing user requests to determine intent
- Routing requests to the appropriate agent
- Managing agent responses
- Handling errors and fallbacks

The Agent Orchestrator is implemented in the `MPAI_Agent_Orchestrator` class, which follows the Singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance exists throughout the application lifecycle.

### Base Agent

The Base Agent provides a common interface for all agents. It defines the methods that all agents must implement and provides default implementations for common functionality.

The Base Agent is implemented in the `MPAI_Base_Agent` class, which is an abstract class that all specialized agents must extend.

### Specialized Agents

Specialized Agents provide specialized capabilities for specific tasks. Each specialized agent focuses on a particular domain or type of task, such as MemberPress-related tasks or command validation.

The plugin includes several built-in specialized agents:

- **MemberPress Agent**: Handles MemberPress-related tasks
- **Command Validation Agent**: Validates commands before execution

### Agent Interfaces

Agent Interfaces define the contract that agents must fulfill. They specify the methods that agents must implement and the data structures they must use.

The plugin includes several agent interfaces:

- **MPAI_Agent_Interface**: The base interface that all agents must implement
- **MPAI_Specialized_Agent_Interface**: An interface for specialized agents that provide domain-specific capabilities

## Agent Registration

Agents are registered with the Agent Orchestrator during plugin initialization. The registration process involves:

1. Creating an instance of the agent
2. Registering the agent with the Agent Orchestrator
3. Configuring the agent's specialization scoring

```php
// Get the Agent Orchestrator instance
$agent_orchestrator = MPAI_Agent_Orchestrator::get_instance();

// Register the MemberPress Agent
$memberpress_agent = new MPAI_MemberPress_Agent();
$agent_orchestrator->register_agent('memberpress', $memberpress_agent);

// Register the Command Validation Agent
$command_validation_agent = new MPAI_Command_Validation_Agent();
$agent_orchestrator->register_agent('command_validation', $command_validation_agent);
```

## Agent Specialization Scoring

Agent Specialization Scoring is the mechanism that determines which agent is best suited for a given request. It analyzes the user's message and assigns a score to each agent based on how well it matches the agent's specialization.

The scoring process involves:

1. Analyzing the user's message to extract key features
2. Comparing these features to each agent's specialization
3. Assigning a score to each agent based on the match
4. Selecting the agent with the highest score

Each agent implements its own specialization scoring logic in the `get_specialization_score` method:

```php
public function get_specialization_score($message) {
    // Analyze the message
    $score = 0;
    
    // Check for keywords related to this agent's specialization
    if (strpos(strtolower($message), 'memberpress') !== false) {
        $score += 10;
    }
    
    if (strpos(strtolower($message), 'membership') !== false) {
        $score += 5;
    }
    
    // Add more scoring logic as needed
    
    return $score;
}
```

## Request Routing

Request routing is the process of directing a user's request to the appropriate agent. The Agent Orchestrator handles this process by:

1. Receiving the user's message
2. Calculating specialization scores for all registered agents
3. Selecting the agent with the highest score
4. Forwarding the request to the selected agent
5. Returning the agent's response to the user

```php
public function process_request($message, $context = []) {
    // Calculate specialization scores
    $scores = [];
    foreach ($this->agents as $agent_id => $agent) {
        $scores[$agent_id] = $agent->get_specialization_score($message);
    }
    
    // Select the agent with the highest score
    $selected_agent_id = array_keys($scores, max($scores))[0];
    $selected_agent = $this->agents[$selected_agent_id];
    
    // Process the request with the selected agent
    $response = $selected_agent->process_request($message, $context);
    
    return $response;
}
```

## Agent Response Processing

Agent Response Processing is the handling of responses from agents. The Agent Orchestrator processes agent responses by:

1. Receiving the response from the agent
2. Validating the response format
3. Enriching the response with additional information if needed
4. Formatting the response for presentation to the user
5. Handling any errors or exceptions

## Error Handling

The Agent System includes robust error handling to ensure that errors are handled gracefully and do not disrupt the user experience. Error handling includes:

1. Validating input before processing
2. Catching and logging exceptions
3. Providing fallback responses when errors occur
4. Notifying administrators of critical errors

## Security Considerations

The Agent System includes several security measures:

1. Input validation to prevent injection attacks
2. Permission checks to ensure only authorized users can access certain functionality
3. Rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. Logging of all agent actions for auditing purposes

## Extending the Agent System

The Agent System is designed to be extensible, allowing developers to create custom agents for specific needs. To create a custom agent:

1. Create a new class that extends `MPAI_Base_Agent`
2. Implement the required methods
3. Register the agent with the Agent Orchestrator

```php
class My_Custom_Agent extends MPAI_Base_Agent {
    public function get_specialization_score($message) {
        // Implement specialization scoring logic
    }
    
    public function process_request($message, $context = []) {
        // Implement request processing logic
    }
}

// Register the custom agent
$agent_orchestrator = MPAI_Agent_Orchestrator::get_instance();
$custom_agent = new My_Custom_Agent();
$agent_orchestrator->register_agent('custom', $custom_agent);
```

## Best Practices

1. Create specialized agents for specific domains or tasks
2. Implement robust specialization scoring to ensure accurate routing
3. Handle errors gracefully and provide helpful error messages
4. Log agent actions for debugging and auditing
5. Follow the security guidelines to prevent misuse
