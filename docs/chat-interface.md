Would you like to see more details about any of these memberships?
```

```
User: Create a new monthly membership called "Silver Plan" for $29.99
AI: I'll create a new monthly membership called "Silver Plan" priced at $29.99.

[Creating Membership...]

Success! I've created the "Silver Plan" membership with the following details:
- Name: Silver Plan
- Price: $29.99
- Billing: Monthly
- ID: 123

Would you like to set up access rules for this membership now?
```

### Advanced Features

#### Command Execution

Users can execute commands through the chat interface:

1. Request a command in natural language
2. The AI suggests the appropriate command
3. Click the command button to execute it
4. Results are displayed in the chat

Example:

```
User: Show me all users with an active subscription
AI: I can help you with that. Here's the command to show all users with active subscriptions:

[Run Command: wp user list --has_active_subscription=true]

Would you like me to run this command?
```

#### Content Creation

Users can create content through the chat interface:

1. Request content creation in natural language
2. The AI generates the content
3. Preview the content in the chat
4. Confirm to publish or edit as needed

## Integration with Agent System

The Chat Interface integrates with the Agent System to provide specialized handling of different types of requests:

1. The user's message is sent to the ChatInterfaceService
2. The service passes the message to the AgentOrchestrator
3. The orchestrator selects the most appropriate agent based on the message content
4. The selected agent processes the message and generates a response
5. The response is formatted and returned to the chat interface

This integration allows the system to handle a wide range of requests, from general questions to specific MemberPress operations, using specialized agents for each domain.

## Error Handling

The Chat Interface implements comprehensive error handling:

1. **Network Errors**: Detected and displayed with retry options
2. **API Errors**: Formatted and displayed with appropriate context
3. **Command Errors**: Displayed with suggestions for resolution
4. **Input Validation**: Prevents invalid inputs with helpful messages
5. **Fallback Responses**: Provided when the AI cannot generate a suitable response

Example error handling:

```
User: Delete all memberships
AI: I'm sorry, but I cannot perform bulk deletion of all memberships as this could be destructive. 

If you want to delete a specific membership, please provide the membership name or ID. For example:
"Delete membership with ID 123" or "Delete the Gold Plan membership"

If you need to perform bulk operations, please consider using the WordPress admin interface with appropriate backups.
```

## Customization

The Chat Interface can be customized through the settings:

1. Navigate to AI Assistant > Settings > Chat Interface
2. Configure the following options:
   - Theme: Light, Dark, or System
   - Message Display: Compact or Expanded
   - Code Highlighting: Enable/Disable
   - Interactive Elements: Enable/Disable
   - History Retention: Number of days to retain chat history
3. Click "Save Changes"

## Security Considerations

The Chat Interface implements several security measures:

1. **Input Sanitization**: All user input is sanitized before processing
2. **Output Escaping**: All AI responses are properly escaped before display
3. **Command Validation**: Commands are validated against a whitelist
4. **Authentication**: Only authenticated users with appropriate permissions can access the chat
5. **Rate Limiting**: Requests are rate-limited to prevent abuse

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Slow Responses
- **Issue**: AI responses take a long time to generate
- **Solution**: Check your internet connection
- **Solution**: Reduce the complexity of your queries
- **Solution**: Check system resources and network connectivity

#### Incorrect Responses
- **Issue**: AI provides incorrect or irrelevant information
- **Solution**: Rephrase your question to be more specific
- **Solution**: Provide more context in your query
- **Solution**: Report the issue to improve the AI's training

#### UI Issues
- **Issue**: Chat interface elements not displaying correctly
- **Solution**: Clear your browser cache
- **Solution**: Try a different browser
- **Solution**: Check for JavaScript errors in the console

### Debugging
