# Edge Case Test Suite and Input Validator Fixes

## Problem

The edge case test suite in the MemberPress AI Assistant was experiencing PHP fatal errors due to several issues:

1. **Input Validator Error**: The `MPAI_Input_Validator` class was trying to call an undefined method `MPAI_Plugin_Logger::info()` in its validation process.

2. **Obsolete Method Calls**: The edge case tests were referencing obsolete methods in the Context Manager, such as `prepare_context()` and `execute_tool()`.

3. **Test Structure Issues**: The tests were not properly updated to match the current codebase architecture.

## Investigation

We examined the following files:

1. `/includes/class-mpai-input-validator.php` - Contained a dependency on a logger that wasn't properly initialized
2. `/test/edge-cases/test-input-validation.php` - Had references to outdated context manager methods
3. `/test/edge-cases/test-resource-limits.php` - Was using methods that no longer existed in the current architecture

The main issue in the input validator was found on line 276, where it tried to call `$this->logger->info()`, but the logger property wasn't properly defined in the constructor.

## Solution

We implemented the following fixes:

1. **Input Validator Logging**:
   - Replaced `$this->logger->info()` calls with standard `error_log()` function
   - Simplified the constructor by removing the logger initialization

2. **Test Case Updates**:
   - Modified `test-input-validation.php` to use `MPAI_Input_Validator` directly instead of trying to call methods on the Context Manager
   - Fixed three test cases (long input, empty/null input, and special characters input) to use the validator
   - Modified the malformed JSON test case to use the validator and JSON parsing functions

3. **Resource Limits Test Fixes**:
   - Fixed the context window handling test in `test-resource-limits.php` to use the API router instead of a non-existent context manager method
   - Fixed the tool execution test to use `process_tool_request` instead of the non-existent `execute_tool` method

4. **Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive documentation detailing the edge case test suite implementation
   - Documented all test categories and their purposes
   - Added information on how to run the tests and interpret results

## Implementation Details

### 1. Input Validator Logging Fix

```php
// BEFORE:
if (!empty($errors)) {
    $this->logger->info('Validation failed: ' . json_encode($errors));
}

// AFTER:
if (!empty($errors) && function_exists('error_log')) {
    error_log('MPAI Input Validator: Validation failed: ' . json_encode($errors));
}
```

### 2. Edge Case Test Updates

```php
// BEFORE:
$context_manager = new MPAI_Context_Manager();
$result = $context_manager->prepare_context($long_string);

// AFTER:
$validator = new MPAI_Input_Validator();
$validator->add_rule('long_input', ['type' => 'string']);
$result = $validator->validate(['long_input' => $long_string]);
```

### 3. Resource Limits Test Update

```php
// BEFORE:
$result = $context_manager->execute_tool($tool);

// AFTER:
$request = [
    'name' => $tool['tool'],
    'parameters' => json_decode($tool['params'], true)
];
$result = $context_manager->process_tool_request($request);
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Defensive Programming**: Always check for object existence before calling methods, and provide fallbacks where possible.

2. **Architectural Changes**: When refactoring, ensure that all dependent components and tests are updated to match the new architecture.

3. **Error Logging**: Use standard WordPress/PHP error logging methods (`error_log()`) as fallbacks when custom logging systems might not be available.

4. **Test Case Independence**: Design test cases to be independent of specific implementations, allowing them to be more resilient to architectural changes.

5. **Documentation Importance**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of the test system to make fixing issues easier in the future.

These fixes make the edge case test suite fully functional with the current codebase structure, enhancing the robustness of the plugin by allowing proper testing of boundary conditions.
