## Problem Statement

The Error Recovery System test was failing with a 500 error when run through the admin interface. This was caused by a dependency issue where the Error Recovery System relied on the Plugin Logger, but the Plugin Logger wasn't being properly loaded or initialized.

## Solution

The solution involved several fixes:

1. **Dependency Management**: Updated the test scripts to explicitly check for and load the Plugin Logger class before initializing the Error Recovery System.

2. **Function Definitions**: Added proper fallback definitions for `mpai_init_plugin_logger()` and `mpai_init_error_recovery()` functions in both the test script and the direct AJAX handler.

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added more detailed error reporting and try/catch blocks to better identify where issues occur.

4. **Direct Test Option**: Created a standalone test script (`test-error-recovery-direct.php`) that can be accessed directly from the browser for easier debugging.

5. **Debug Information**: Added more debug information to the test output to help diagnose any remaining issues.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Test Script Changes

The `test-error-recovery.php` script was modified to:
- Check for and load the Plugin Logger class
- Define the necessary initialization functions if they don't exist
- Add more debugging information to the output
- Handle exceptions more gracefully

### 2. Direct AJAX Handler Changes

The `direct-ajax-handler.php` file was modified to:
- Load dependencies in the correct order
- Define necessary functions if they don't exist
- Add better error reporting
- Provide detailed error information in the response

### 3. New Direct Test Script

A new file `test-error-recovery-direct.php` was created to provide a direct way to test the Error Recovery System outside of the AJAX framework. This allows for easier debugging and verification of the system.

## Testing

To test the Error Recovery System:

1. Use the built-in test in the Settings > Diagnostic tab
2. Or access the direct test page at `/wp-content/plugins/memberpress-ai-assistant/test/test-error-recovery-page.php`
3. Or use the even more direct test option from the test page

These options provide different levels of debugging information to help identify any remaining issues.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Dependency Management**: When creating a system with dependencies, it's important to explicitly check for and load those dependencies in the correct order.

2. **Function Availability**: Don't assume that functions defined elsewhere are available in all contexts. Use function_exists() checks and provide fallbacks.

3. **Error Reporting**: Detailed error reporting is essential for debugging complex systems, especially in WordPress where multiple plugins can interact.

4. **Alternative Test Paths**: Providing multiple ways to test functionality (AJAX, direct page, simplified script) can make debugging much easier.
