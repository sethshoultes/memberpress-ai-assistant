## Running Tests

### Manual Testing

Follow the procedures in [test-procedures.md](test-procedures.md) for comprehensive manual testing. Key test areas include:

1. Installation and activation
2. Settings configuration
3. Chat interface functionality
4. API integrations (OpenAI, Anthropic)
5. MemberPress data access
6. WP-CLI commands
7. Security and validation
8. Browser compatibility

### Automated Testing

For unit tests:

```bash
# Run all unit tests
wp scaffold plugin-tests memberpress-ai-assistant
cd /tmp/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/memberpress-ai-assistant
composer install
bash bin/install-wp-tests.sh wordpress_test root '' localhost latest
vendor/bin/phpunit

# Run a specific test class
vendor/bin/phpunit --filter=AgentOrchestratorTest
```

For integration tests:

```bash
# Run a specific integration test
wp eval-file test/memberpress-test.php

# Run with debugging
WP_DEBUG=true wp eval-file test/test-agent-system.php
```

## Test Development Guidelines

When creating new tests:

1. **Unit Tests**: Place in the `unit/` directory following PHPUnit conventions
2. **Feature Tests**: Create dedicated test files for each major feature
3. **Test Procedures**: Update test-procedures.md when adding new testable features
4. **Documentation**: Add new tests to this README.md in the appropriate section

### Test File Naming Conventions

- Unit tests: `ClassNameTest.php`
- Feature tests: `test-feature-name.php`
- Integration tests: `system-name-test.php`

## Automated Test Integration

Future plans include:

- GitHub Actions integration for CI/CD
- Automated test runs on pull requests
- Performance benchmark tests
- Visual regression testing for UI components
- End-to-end testing for user workflows

## Contributing to the Test Suite

When contributing new tests:

1. Follow existing patterns and naming conventions
2. Include detailed comments explaining the purpose of each test
3. Update relevant documentation, including this README.md
4. Ensure all tests pass before submitting pull requests
